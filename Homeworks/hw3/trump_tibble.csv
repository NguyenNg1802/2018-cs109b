01-21-2016 13:42:48,Wacko @glennbeck is a sad answer to the @SarahPalinUSA endorsement that Cruz so desperately wanted. Glenn is a failing crying lost soul!

01-21-2016 14:04:54,So sad that @CNN and many others refused to show the massive crowd at the arena yesterday in Oklahoma. Dishonest reporting!
01-21-2016 14:19:26,Sad sack @JebBush has just done another ad on me with special interest money saying I won't beat Hillary - I WILL. But he can't beat me.
01-21-2016 14:32:57,Low energy candidate @JebBush has wasted $80 million on his failed presidential campaign. Millions spent on me. He should go home and relax!
01-21-2016 20:36:09,New Day on CNN treats me very badly. @AlisynCamerota is a disaster. Not going to watch anymore.
01-21-2016 20:40:07,Happy birthday to my friend the great @jacknicklaus - a totally special guy!

01-22-2016 03:56:44,National Review is a failing publication that has lost it's way. It's circulation is way down w its influence being at an all time low. Sad!
01-22-2016 03:56:57,Very few people read the National Review because it only knows how to criticize but not how to lead.
01-22-2016 03:57:22,The late great William F. Buckley would be ashamed of what had happened to his prize the dying National Review!
01-22-2016 13:34:54,Ted Cruz complains about my views on eminent domain but without it we wouldn't have roads highways airports schools or even pipelines.
02-02-2016 20:02:48,Anybody who watched all of Ted Cruz's far too long rambling overly flamboyant speech last nite would say that was his Howard Dean moment!
02-02-2016 22:23:53,On my way to New Hampshire- expecting a big and spirited crowd! #FITN #Trump2016  
02-03-2016 05:12:23,Great job on @donlemon tonight @kayleighmcenany  @cherijacobus begged us for a job. We said no and she went hostile. A real dummy! @CNN
02-03-2016 13:47:33,Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!
02-03-2016 13:56:48,During primetime of the Iowa Caucus Cruz put out a release that @RealBenCarson was quitting the race and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz.
02-03-2016 14:07:25,Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters.
02-03-2016 14:10:53,The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. Fraud
02-03-2016 14:21:03,And finally Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and choice - a total lie!
02-03-2016 14:28:59,Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified.
02-03-2016 19:09:38,I will be interviewed on @greta at 7:00 P.M. Enjoy! @FoxNews
02-03-2016 19:20:55,This was sent out from Ted Cruz- as Iowans arrived at their caucus sites to vote. #CruzFraud 
02-03-2016 19:25:08,The State of Iowa should disqualify Ted Cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated- a total fraud!
02-03-2016 20:22:46,Cruz just lied again- I am and have been totally against #ObamaCare- repeal and replace!
02-03-2016 20:44:28,Dr. Ben Carson blasted Ted Cruz for deceit and dirty tricks and lies.

02-04-2016 03:11:26,Sanders says he wants to run against me because he doesn't want to run against me. He would be so easy to beat!
02-04-2016 06:33:27,Thank you @billoreilly  @KarlRove. Ted Cruz should be immediately disqualified in Iowa with each candidate moving up one notch.
02-04-2016 06:35:50,#ICYMI: @KarlRove  @oreillyfactor discuss what Ted Cruz did to the great people of Iowa- as they went to vote. 
02-04-2016 06:36:44,.@oreillyfactor @KarlRove- as per the show an even more serious Cruz charge is the fraudulent voter violation certificate sent to everyone.
02-04-2016 06:38:05,This is the Cruz voter violation certificate sent to everyone a misdemeanor at minimum.

02-08-2016 12:20:11,Jeb Bush has zero communication skills so he spent a fortune of special interest money on a Super Bowl ad. He is a weak candidate!

02-08-2016 16:33:15,Jeb Bush is desperate - strongly in favor of #CommonCore and very weak on illegal immigration.

02-09-2016 12:00:30,Remember @JebBush wants COMMON CORE (education from D.C.) and is very weak on ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION (come as act of love). Not a leader!
02-09-2016 12:08:19,I know the Governors and Jeb Bush who has gone nasty with lies is by far the weakest of the lot. His family used private eminent domain!
02-09-2016 12:16:37,No-one has done more for people with disabilities than me. I have spent many millions of dollars to help out-and am happy to have done so!
02-09-2016 12:23:37,The polls are now showing that I am the best to win the GENERAL ELECTION. States that are never in play for Repubs will be won by me. Great!

02-11-2016 02:51:40,I have been consistent in my opposition to Common Core. Get rid of Common Core--- keep education local!
02-11-2016 14:13:09,There are no buyers for the worthless @NYDailyNews but little Mort Zuckerman is frantically looking. It is bleeding red ink - a total loser!
02-11-2016 15:11:56,Jeb Bush spent more than $40000000 in New Hampshire to come in 4 or 5 I spent $3000000 to come in 1st. Big difference in capability!
02-11-2016 15:40:04,.@MarkHalperin showed a focus group on @Morning_Joe me using a very bad word. I never said the word left an open blank. Please apologize!

02-12-2016 00:44:06,Cruz caught cold in lie after denial of push polls like lies w/ @RealBenCarson. How can he preach Christian values?

03-02-2016 18:18:37,Marco Rubio lost big last night. I even beat him in Virginia where he spent so much time and money. Now his bosses are desperate and angry!

03-03-2016 03:33:07,Looks like two-time failed candidate Mitt Romney is going to be telling Republicans how to get elected. Not a good messenger!
03-03-2016 11:22:32,Failed candidate Mitt Romneywho ran one of the worst races in presidential historyis working with the establishment to bury a big R win!

03-07-2016 11:48:39,Failed presidential candidate Lindsey Graham should respect me. I destroyed his run brought him from 7% to 0% when he got out. Now nasty!
03-07-2016 12:03:59,Lindsey Graham is all over T.V. much like failed 47% candidate Mitt Romney. These nasty angry jealous  failures have ZERO credibility!
03-07-2016 13:03:16,We cannot let the failing REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT who could not stop Obama (twice) ruin the MOVEMENT with millions of  $'s in false ads!
03-07-2016 13:10:22,I will be using Facebook and Twitter to expose dishonest lightweight Senator Marco Rubio. A record no-show in Senate he is scamming Florida

03-12-2016 13:35:19,Absentee Governor Kasich voted for NAFTA and NAFTA devastated Ohio - a disaster from which it never recovered. Kasich is good for Mexico!
03-12-2016 14:17:41,Ohio had the biggest budget increase in the U.S. If it were not for striking oil they would be bust! Governor Kasich in favor of TPP fraud!
03-12-2016 14:35:09,The rally in Cincinnati is ON. Media put out false reports that it was cancelled. Will be great - love you Ohio!

03-12-2016 18:06:24,Word is-early voting in FL is very dishonest. Little Marco his State Chairman  their minions are working overtime-trying to rig the vote.
03-12-2016 18:07:04,We are asking law enforcement to check for dishonest early voting in Florida- on behalf of little Marco Rubio. No way to run a country!
03-12-2016 18:24:56,The last person that Hillary or Bernie want to run against is Donald Trump --- and that is fact!
03-12-2016 18:36:45,It is Clinton and Sanders people who disrupted my rally in Chicago - and then they say I must talk to my people. Phony politicians!

03-12-2016 23:41:57,USSS did an excellent job stopping the maniac running to the stage. He has ties to ISIS. Should be in jail! ?ssr=true
03-13-2016 03:30:04,Wow Kasich didn't qualify to run in the state of Pennsylvania not enough signatures. Big problem!
03-13-2016 11:48:44,Bernie Sanders is lying when he says his disruptors aren't told to go to my events. Be careful Bernie or my supporters will go to yours!
03-13-2016 11:58:17,Ohio Gov.Kasich voted for NAFTA from which Ohio has never recovered. Now he wants TPP which will be even worse. Ohio steel and coal dying!
03-13-2016 14:49:44,Gov.Kasich of Ohio just stated on a morning show that he doesn't watch politics or anything on television he only watches the @GolfChannel
03-13-2016 17:06:31,Thank you Kevin. With unification of the party Republican wins will be massive! 
03-13-2016 17:07:00,Carly Fiorina- I agree! Ted Cruz is just another politician. All talk- no action!
03-13-2016 18:26:20,Because Gov. Kasich cannot run in the state of Pennsylvania-he cannot win the nomination-  should not be allowed to compete in Ohio on Tue.
03-13-2016 18:53:07,The failing @nytimes is truly one of the worst newspapers. They knowingly write lies and never even call to fact check. Really bad people!

03-15-2016 04:10:00,Kasich voted for NAFTA a disaster for Ohio and now wants the even worse TPP approved. Vote Trump and end this madness!
03-15-2016 04:21:20,Rubio is weak on illegal immigration with the worst voting record in the U.S. Senate in many years. He will never MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
03-15-2016 10:25:53,I will bring our jobs back to America fix our military and take care of our vets end Common Core and ObamaCare protect 2nd A build WALL
03-15-2016 10:39:06,Please remember I am the ONLY candidate who is self-funding his campaign. Kasich Rubio and Cruz are all bought and paid for by lobbyists!
03-15-2016 11:31:46,Don't reward Mitt Romney who let us all down in the last presidential race by voting for Kasich (who voted for NAFTA open borders etc.).
03-15-2016 12:10:10,Good morning Ohio! Some additional information from my daughter @IvankaTrump! #VoteTrump #SuperTuesday

03-15-2016 14:53:41,Watching John Kasich being interviewed - acting so innocent and like such a nice guy. Remember him in second debate until I put him down.
03-15-2016 15:03:34,Ohio is losing jobs to Mexico now losing Ford (and many others). Kasich is weak on illegal immigration. We need strong borders now!
03-15-2016 16:03:57,In presidential voting so far John Kasich is ZERO for 22. So why would he be a good candidate? Hillary would beat him I will beat Hillary!
03-15-2016 16:16:16,I will bring our jobs back to the U.S. and keep our companies from leaving. Nobody else can do it. Our economy will sing again.
03-15-2016 19:11:12,A lot of complaints from people saying my name is not on the ballot in various places in Florida? Hope this is false.
03-15-2016 23:06:59,Word is that despite a record amount spent on negative and phony ads I had a massive victory in Florida. Numbers out soon!
03-16-2016 00:05:04,Can't watch Crazy Megyn anymore. Talks about me at 43% but never mentions that there are four people in race. With two people big  over!

03-17-2016 10:40:53,Great news that @FoxNews has cancelled the additional debate. How many times can the same people ask the same question? I beat Cruz debating
03-17-2016 12:19:55,Crazy @megynkelly is now complaining that  @oreillyfactor did not defend her against me - yet her bad show is a total hit piece on me.Tough!
03-17-2016 12:28:17,The reason lyin' Ted Cruz has lost so much of the evangelical vote is that they are very smart and just don't tolerate liars-a big problem!
03-17-2016 13:08:55,.@WSJ Editorial says Clinton primary vote total is 8646551.Trump's is 7533692-a knock. But she had only 3 opponents-I had 16.Apologize
03-17-2016 13:11:31,.@WSJ is bad at math. The good news is nobody cares what they say in their editorials anymore especially me!
03-17-2016 13:22:07,Please explain to the dummies at the @WSJ  Editorial Board that I love to debate and have won according to Drudge etc. all 11 of them!
03-17-2016 16:44:45,See you in Arizona on Friday and Saturday. 
03-17-2016 16:54:21,Looking like my 5 victories on Tuesday will be just as good as if I won Ohio. Two more days and Ohio was mine!
03-17-2016 16:58:04,Highly overrated  crazy @megynkelly is always complaining about Trump and yet she devotes her shows to me. Focus on others Megyn!
03-17-2016 18:33:31,Who should star in a reboot of Liar Liar- Hillary Clinton or Ted Cruz? Let me know. 
03-17-2016 20:30:08,MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
03-18-2016 00:37:17,Hillary Clinton has been involved in corruption for most of her professional life!
03-18-2016 15:56:16,Join us in Salt Lake City Utah- tonight!#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016
03-18-2016 16:42:29,Lyin' Ted Cruz lost all five races on Tuesday-and he was just given the jinx - a Lindsey Graham endorsement. Also backed Jeb. Lindsey got 0!
03-18-2016 19:03:48,Senator @LindseyGrahamSC made horrible statements about @SenTedCruz – and then he endorsed him. No wonder nobody trusts politicians!
03-18-2016 19:08:05,.@EWErickson got fired like a dog from RedStateand now he is the one leading opposition against me.
03-18-2016 19:44:17,With millions of dollars of negative and phony ads against me by the establishment my numbers continue to go up. Can anyone explain this?
03-18-2016 19:57:35,Club For Growth tried to extort $1000000 from me. When I said NO they went hostile with negative ads. Disgraceful!
03-18-2016 20:05:51,Club for Growth letter- trying to extort $1000000.00 from me. Remember I said- NO! 
03-18-2016 20:07:50,Going to Salt Lake City Utah for a big rally. Lyin' Ted Cruz should not be allowed to win there - Mormons don't like LIARS! I beat Hillary
03-18-2016 20:18:14,Failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney the man who choked and let us all down is now endorsing Lyin' Ted Cruz. This is good for me!
03-18-2016 20:21:17,Failed Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney was campaigning with John Kasich  Marco Rubio and now he is endorsing Ted Cruz. 1/2
03-18-2016 20:37:31,Mitt Romney is a mixed up man who doesn't have a clue. No wonder he lost!
03-18-2016 20:39:05,Join me tomorrow! #Trump2016#MakeAmericaGreatAgain 
03-18-2016 20:41:53,Thank you Arizona- I love you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 
03-18-2016 21:55:11,Everybody should boycott the @megynkelly show. Never worth watching. Always a hit on Trump! She is sick  the most overrated person on tv.
03-19-2016 00:40:10,Do you believe that Hillary Clinton now wants Obamacare for illegal immigrants? She should spend more time taking care of our great Vets!
03-19-2016 01:05:55,I guess I have reached yet another ceiling  - 49.7% with four people. My highest Reuters poll yet! Thank you! 
03-19-2016 01:53:57,Why haven't they released the final Missouri victory for us yet? Could it be because Cruz's guy runs Missouri?
03-19-2016 03:43:42,Just leaving Salt Lake City Utah- fantastic crowd with no interruptions. Love Utah- will be back!
03-19-2016 03:45:23,Watching @loudobbsnews- fantastic show! Has very interesting take on Paul Ryan.
03-19-2016 04:05:20,Heading to Phoneix. Will be arriving soon. Tomorrow a big day. Tremendous crowds expected! #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
03-19-2016 04:11:18,While I have never met @nytdavidbrooks of the NY Times I consider him one of the dumbest of all pundits- he has no sense of the real world!
03-19-2016 04:25:54,Reading @nytdavidbrooks of the NY Times is a total waste of time he is a clown with no awareness of the world around him- dummy!
03-19-2016 04:28:43,Landing in Phoenix now. Tomorrow's events will be amazing! #Trump2016
03-19-2016 04:40:27,Thank you- New York! I love you!#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 
03-19-2016 15:14:32,Crazy @megynkelly says I don't (won't) go on her show and she still gets good ratings. But almost all of her shows are negative hits on me!
03-19-2016 15:16:55,If crazy @megynkelly didn't cover me so much on her terrible show her ratings would totally tank. She is so average in so many ways!
03-19-2016 15:40:55,Great to be back in Arizona!#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 
03-19-2016 15:50:59,Wow @CNN ratings are up 75% because it's all Trump all the time. The networks are making a fortune off of me! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
03-19-2016 19:38:11,THANK YOU ARIZONA! 20000 amazing supporters! Get out and #VoteTrump on Tuesday. I love you!#MakeAmericaGreatAgain

03-20-2016 05:05:04,The rallies in Utah and Arizona were great! Tremendous crowds and spirit. Just returned but will be going back soon.
03-20-2016 11:55:27,Will be interviewed on @ThisWeekABC this morning. Enjoy!
03-20-2016 16:13:50,Why is it that the horrendous protesters who scream curse punch shut down roads/doors during my RALLIES  are never blamed by media? SAD!
03-20-2016 18:52:32,The protesters blocked a major highway yesterday delaying entry to my RALLY in Arizona by hours and the media blames my supporters!
03-20-2016 19:10:55,So the highly overrated anchor @megynkelly is allowed to constantly say bad things about me on her show but I can't fight back? Wrong!
03-20-2016 19:45:33,Big Republican Dinner tonight at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach. I will be there!
03-20-2016 20:41:03,Wow President Obama just landed in Cuba a big deal and Raul Castro wasn't even there to greet him. He greeted Pope and others. No respect
03-22-2016 12:04:43,Do you all remember how beautiful and safe a place Brussels was. Not anymore it is from a different world! U.S. must be vigilant and smart!
03-22-2016 14:53:34,President Obama looks and sounds so ridiculous making his speech in Cuba especially in the shadows of Brussels. He is being treated badly!
03-22-2016 14:54:32,MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
03-22-2016 15:32:36,I have proven to be far more correct about terrorism than anybody- and it’s not even close. Hopefully AZ and UT will be voting for me today!
03-22-2016 16:16:10,Watch this clip from earlier this year. Time  time again I have been right about terrorism. It’s time to get tough! 
03-22-2016 18:21:24,My heart  prayers go out to all of the victims of the terrible #Brussels tragedy. This madness must be stopped and I will stop it.

03-22-2016 19:17:41,Obama and all others have been so weak and so politically correct that terror groups are forming and getting stronger! Shame.
03-22-2016 22:41:46,Pres. Obama should leave the baseball game in Cuba immediately  get home to Washington- where a #POTUS under a serious emergency belongs!
03-23-2016 01:53:05,Lyin' Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G.Q. shoot in his ad. Be careful Lyin' Ted or I will spill the beans on your wife!
03-23-2016 02:59:29,Incompetent Hillary despite the horrible attack in Brussels today wants borders to be weak and open-and let the Muslims flow in.  No way!
03-23-2016 03:30:10,Thank you Arizona! #Trump2016#WesternTuesday #TrumpTrain 
03-23-2016 03:43:50,Much bigger win than anticipated in Arizona. Thank you I will never forget!
03-23-2016 04:04:34,Hopefully the Republican Party can come together and have a big WIN in November paving the way for many great Supreme Court Justices!
03-23-2016 14:22:51,Lyin' Ted Cruz denied that he had anything to do with the G.Q. model photo post of Melania. That's why we call him Lyin' Ted!
03-23-2016 18:35:50,Thank you Arizona! #Trump2016#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #TrumpTrain 
03-23-2016 19:45:44,Lyin’ Ted Cruz steals foreign policy from me and lines from Michael Douglas— just another dishonest politician.
03-23-2016 19:49:49,Low energy Jeb Bush just endorsed a man he truly hates Lyin’ Ted Cruz. Honestly I can’t blame Jeb in that I drove him into oblivion!
03-23-2016 19:53:39,Just watched Hillary deliver a prepackaged speech on terror. She’s been in office fighting terror for 20 years- and look where we are!
03-23-2016 19:54:59,I will be the best by far in fighting terror. I’m the only one that was right from the beginning  now Lyin’ Ted  others are copying me.
03-23-2016 20:02:29,I think having Jeb's endorsement hurts Lyin' Ted. Jeb spent more than $150000000 and got nothing. I spent a fraction of that and am first!
03-23-2016 21:12:54,While I believe I will clinch before Cleveland and get more than 1237 delegates it is unfair in that there have been so many in the race!
03-23-2016 21:44:44,I want to thank @RealSheriffJoe for all of his help in our historic Arizona win. Could not have done it without you Joe!
03-23-2016 23:25:00,MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
03-24-2016 11:47:26,N.A.T.O. is obsolete and must be changed to additionally focus on terrorism as well as some of the things it is currently focused on!
03-24-2016 11:59:06,We pay a disproportionate share of the cost of N.A.T.O. Why? It is time to renegotiate and the time is now!
03-24-2016 14:02:27,It is amazing how @LindseyGrahamSC gets on so many T.V. shows talking negatively about me when I beat him so badly (ZERO) in his pres run!
03-24-2016 14:07:07,.@LindseyGrahamSC and Lyin' Ted Cruz are two politicians who are very much alike - ALL TALK AND NO ACTION! Both talk about ISIS do nothing!
03-24-2016 14:14:14,These politicians like Cruz and Graham who have watched ISIS and many other problems develop for years do nothing to make things better!
03-24-2016 14:17:57,Remember when I recently said that Brussels is a hell hole and a mess and the failing @nytimes wrote a critical article. I was so right!
03-24-2016 14:38:13,It is amazing how often I am right only to be criticized by the media. Illegal immigration take the oil build the wall Muslims NATO!
03-24-2016 14:46:29,Hillary Clinton has been working on solving the terrorism problem for years. TIME FOR A CHANGE I WILL SOLVE - AND FAST!
03-24-2016 15:33:34,.@TheView T.V. show which is failing so badly that it will soon be taken off thr air is constantly asking me to go on. I TELL THEM NO
03-24-2016 15:39:16,Explain how the women on The View which is a total disaster since the great Barbara Walters left ever got their jobs. @abc is wasting time
03-24-2016 15:52:11,Just announced that as many as 5000 ISIS fighters have infiltrated Europe. Also many in U.S.  I TOLD YOU SO! I alone can fix this problem!
03-24-2016 15:55:32,Europe and the U.S. must immediately stop taking in people from Syria. This will be the destruction of civilization as we know it! So sad!
03-24-2016 16:02:06,Endorsements for Lyin' Ted Cruz- 
03-24-2016 18:14:18,MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 
03-24-2016 21:48:17,Just won a big federal lawsuit similar in certain ways to the Trump U case but the press refuses to write about it. If I lost-monster story!
03-24-2016 22:31:17,I didn't start the fight with Lyin'Ted Cruz over the GQ cover pic of Melania he did. He knew the PAC was putting it out - hence Lyin' Ted!
03-24-2016 22:42:27,Wow just released that $67 million in negative ads was spent on me. How am I still number one - by a lot?
03-26-2016 02:43:18,Top suspect in Paris massacre Salah Abdeslam who also knew of the Brussels attack is no longer talking. Weak leaders ridiculous laws!
03-26-2016 15:19:31,The media is so after me on women  Wow this is a tough business. Nobody has more respect for women than Donald Trump!
03-26-2016 19:01:42,The press is going out of their way to convince people that I do not like or respect women when they know that it is just the opposite!
03-26-2016 19:13:48,Lyin' Ted Cruz is now trying to convince prople that his problems with The National Enq.were caused by me. I had NOTHING to do with story!
03-26-2016 19:20:33,Nobody will protect our Nation like Donald J. Trump. Our military will be greatly strengthened and our borders will be strong. Illegals out!
03-26-2016 19:27:56,Wisconsin's economy is doing poorly and like everywhere else in U.S. jobs are leaving. I will make our economy strong again - bring in jobs
03-26-2016 20:12:01,Don't believe the @FoxNews Polls they are just another phony hit job on me. I will beat Hillary Clinton easily in the General Election.
03-26-2016 20:16:02,Remember I am the only candidate who is self-funding. While I am given little credit for this by the voters I am not bought like others!
03-27-2016 13:02:06,I am interviewed on This Week on @ABC this morning. Enjoy!
03-27-2016 14:14:05,Wow sleepy eyes @chucktodd is at it again. He is do totally biased. The things I am saying are correct. - far better vision than the others
03-27-2016 14:23:51,My statement on NATO being obsolete and disproportionately too expensive (and unfair) for the U.S. are now finally receiving plaudits!
03-27-2016 19:41:16,Happy Easter to all have a great day!
03-27-2016 20:37:17,Another radical Islamic attack this time in Pakistan targeting Christian women  children. At least 67 dead400 injured. I alone can solve
03-27-2016 20:55:59,Why can't the pundits be honest? Hopefully we are all looking for a strong and great country again. I will make it strong and great!  JOBS!
03-27-2016 21:11:43,Just to show you how unfair Republican primary politics can be I won the State of Louisiana and get less delegates than Cruz-Lawsuit coming
03-27-2016 22:16:52,See Lyin' Ted even the @DailyBeast (no fan of mine) says this story came from Rubio not Trump! 
03-28-2016 01:17:57,The United States cannot continue to make such bad one-sided trade deals. There are only so many jobs we can give up. No more!
03-28-2016 11:18:50,I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 7:30. Things are looking good had a great Easter-look forward to spending the week in Wisconsin!
03-28-2016 14:45:44,Kirsten Powers: Anti- Trump Operative was Aggressively Shopping Cruz Story via the Gateway Pundit: 
03-28-2016 17:25:23,A detainee released from Gitmo has killed an American. When will our so-called leaders ever learn!
03-28-2016 22:18:21,Ted Cruz is incensed that I want to refocus NATO on terrorism as well as current mission but also want others to PAY FAIR SHARE a must!
03-28-2016 22:34:11,Just released that international gangs are all over our cities. This will end when I am President!
03-28-2016 23:13:27,After the way I beat Gov. Scott Walker (and Jeb Rand Marco and all others) in the Presidential Primaries no way he would ever endorse me!
03-29-2016 00:57:35,Lyin'Ted Cruz is weak  losing big so now he wants to debate again. But according to DrudgeTime and on-line polls I have won all debates
03-29-2016 01:04:06,Lyin' Ted I have already beaten you in all debates and am way ahead of you in votes and delegates. You should focus on jobs  illegal imm!
03-29-2016 01:07:23,We need to secure our borders ASAP. No games we must be smart tough and vigilant. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN  MAKE AMERICA STRONG AGAIN!
03-29-2016 13:34:36,Wow @CNN has nothing but my opponents on their shows. Really one-sided and unfair reporting. Maybe I shouldn't do their town-hall tonight!
03-29-2016 14:16:19,I have millions more votes/hundreds more dels than Cruz or Kasich and yet am not being treated properly by the Republican Party or the RNC.
03-29-2016 14:45:37,How come the @TODAYshow  @chucktodd show the new @NBCNews Poll for Hillary vs Bernie but do not show the SAME poll where I am killing Cruz?
03-29-2016 16:41:33,Wow Corey Lewandowski my campaign manager and a very decent man was just charged with assaulting a reporter. Look at tapes-nothing there!
03-29-2016 16:44:36,Why aren't people looking at this reporters earliest statement as to what happened that is before she found out the episode was on tape?
03-29-2016 19:05:15,Victory press conference was over. Why is she allowed to grab me and shout questions? Can I press charges? 
03-29-2016 19:18:53,This was the reporters statement- when she found out there was tape from my facility she changed her tune. 
03-29-2016 19:35:20,Why is this reporter touching me as I leave news conference? What is in her hand?? 
03-29-2016 19:38:03,MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

04-01-2016 04:23:25,The Club For Growthwhich asked me for $1000000 in an extortion attempt just put up a Wisconsin ad with incorrect math.What a dumb group!
04-01-2016 04:29:49,The Club For Growth said in their ad that 465 delegates (Cruz) plus 143 delegates (Kasich) is more than my 739 delegates. Try again!
04-01-2016 14:24:46,The National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) said that our open border is the biggest physical  economic threat facing the American people!
04-01-2016 14:25:17,For the 1st time in American history America’s 16500 border patrol agents have issue a presidential primary endorsement—me! Thank you.

04-01-2016 22:36:39,MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 
04-02-2016 01:44:00,Is it possible for @megynkelly to cover anyone but Donald Trump on her terrible show. She totally misrepresents my words and positions! BAD.
04-02-2016 02:09:29,If @megynkelly stopped covering me on her show her ratings would drop like a rock! My h to h interview with @AC360 beat her by millions!
04-02-2016 02:21:56,I will be in Wisconsin until the election. Jobs trade and immigration will be big factors. I will bring jobs back home - make great deals!
04-02-2016 11:15:20,Wisconsin has suffered a great loss of jobs and trade but if I win all of the bad things happening in the U.S. will be rapidly reversed!

04-07-2016 00:30:39,I was not scheduled to be on the @oreillyfactor. Pure fiction!
04-07-2016 00:31:02,Unbelievable evening. Just made a speech in front 17000 amazing New Yorkers in Bethpage Long Island--- great to be home!

04-07-2016 19:31:50,Ted Cruz attacked New Yorkers and New York values- we don't forget! 
04-08-2016 12:03:23,So great to be in New York. Catching up on many things (remember I am still running a major business while I campaign) and loving it!
04-08-2016 19:12:12,Jennifer is a terrific person.

04-08-2016 21:09:44,“Donald Trump—The Disrupter” will air on @FoxNews Saturday night and Sunday night at 8 PM ET. Anchored by @BretBaier. @johnrobertsFox
04-09-2016 03:07:00,Isn't it a shame that the person who will have by far the most delegates and many millions more votes than anyone else me still must fight
04-09-2016 11:22:32,Bernie Sanders says that Hillary Clinton is unqualified to be president. Based on her decision making ability I can go along with that!
04-09-2016 21:29:18,A great honor to visit the 9/11 Memorial Museum with my wife @MELANIATRUMP today. #NewYorkValues 
04-10-2016 13:40:23,The @nytimes purposely covers me so inaccurately. I want other nations to pay the U.S. for our defense of them. We are the suckers-no more!
04-10-2016 13:47:57,I win a state in votes and then get non-representative delegates because they are offered all sorts of goodies by Cruz campaign. Bad system!
04-10-2016 19:23:50,#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016
04-11-2016 00:28:54,How is it possible that the people of the great State of Colorado never got to vote in the Republican Primary? Great anger - totally unfair!
04-11-2016 00:50:56,The people of Colorado had their vote taken away from them by the phony politicians. Biggest story in politics. This will not be allowed!
04-11-2016 10:45:01,I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 7:00 A.M. Enjoy!
04-11-2016 15:29:51,This is happening all over our country—great people being disenfranchised bypoliticians. Repub party is in trouble! 
04-11-2016 20:40:53,Colorado Trump Delegates Scratched from Ballots at GOP Convention 
04-11-2016 20:58:42,Why does the liberal media think Bill O'Reilly  (@oreillyfactor) is a complete and total vulgarian? I don't think so!

04-14-2016 03:53:59,The rules DID CHANGE in Colorado shortly after I entered the race in June because the pols and their bosses knew I would win with the voters

04-17-2016 13:28:41,I'll be in one of my favorite places this morning Staten Island. Big crowd will be fun!
04-17-2016 13:34:25,Lyin' Ted Cruz will never be able to beat Hillary. Despite a rigged delegate system I am hundreds of delegates ahead of him.
04-17-2016 13:38:31,Lyin' Ted Cruz can't get votes (I am millions ahead of him) so he has to get his delegates from the Republican bosses. It won't work!
04-17-2016 13:41:38,Crooked Hillary Clinton is spending a fortune on ads against me. I am the one person she doesn't want to run against. Will be such fun!
04-17-2016 14:34:12,I would have millions of votes more than Hillary except for the fact that I had 17 opponents and she just had a socialist named Bernie!
04-17-2016 21:01:04,Thank you California! Will see you soon! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain  
04-17-2016 23:04:53,Thank you for today's endorsement New York Veteran Police Association! #NewYorkValues  
04-18-2016 10:58:00,Lyin' Ted Cruz can't win with the voters so he has to sell himself to the bosses-I am millions of VOTES ahead! Hillary would destroy him  K
04-18-2016 11:02:24,Kasich only looks O.K. in polls against Hillary because nobody views him as a threat and therefore have placed ZERO negative ads against him
04-18-2016 17:50:31,New York we will make America great again! 
04-18-2016 21:54:52,Lyin’ Ted Cruz even voted against Superstorm Sandy aid and September 11th help. So many New Yorkers devastated. Cruz hates New York!

04-21-2016 10:22:03,Senator Ted Cruz has been MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED from race. He said Kasich should get out for same reason. I think both should get out!
04-21-2016 21:47:21,Both Ted Cruz and John Kasich have no path to victory. They should both drop out of the race so that the Republican Party can unify!
04-21-2016 22:16:27,Cruz said Kasich should leave because he couldn't get to 1237. Now he can't get to 1237. Drop out LYIN' Ted.
04-22-2016 15:00:11,I met Prince on numerous occasions. He was an amazing talent and wonderful guy. He will be greatly missed!

04-24-2016 01:41:57,I had a great day campaigning in Connecticut. Looking for a big vote on Tuesday!
04-24-2016 01:48:17,As soon as John Kasich is hit with negative ads he will drop like a rock in the polls against Crooked Hillary Clinton. I will win!
04-24-2016 02:01:25,.@Borisep was great on @JudgeJeanine tonight. Very smart commentary that will prove to be correct!
04-24-2016 13:58:53,.@AndreBauer  Great job and advice on @CNN  @jaketapper  Thank you!
04-24-2016 14:01:37,I will be in Maryland this afternoon for a major rally. Things are looking good for Tuesday!
04-25-2016 01:27:12,I am happy to hear how badly the @nytimes is doing. It is a seriously failing paper with readership which is way down. Becoming irrelevant!
04-25-2016 03:39:58,Wow just announced that Lyin' Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. DESPERATION!
04-25-2016 03:49:17,Lyin' Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate. Their donors  special interest groups are not happy with them. Sad!
04-25-2016 11:54:21,Lyin' Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one. Shows weakness!
04-25-2016 11:59:06,Shows how weak and desperate Lyin' Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses.
04-25-2016 16:15:58,Kasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him. Typical politician - can't make a deal work.
04-25-2016 16:16:27,On the way to the great state of Rhode Island- big rally. Then to Pennsylvania for rest of day and night!

04-30-2016 13:31:13,The protesters in California were thugs and criminals. Many are professionals. They should be dealt with strongly by law enforcement!

05-02-2016 11:12:40,Crooked Hillary Clinton said she is used to dealing with men who get off the reservation. Actually she has done poorly with such men!
05-02-2016 11:21:02,Gov Mike Pence has just stated that Donald Trump has taken a strong stance on Hoosier jobs and he thanks me! I will bring back jobs to USA.
05-02-2016 14:06:30,Everybody is talking about the protesters burning the American flags and proudly waving Mexican flags. I want America First - so do voters!

05-03-2016 23:02:55,Wow Lyin' Ted Cruz really went wacko today. Made all sorts of crazy charges. Can't function under pressure - not very presidential. Sad!
05-03-2016 23:08:44,Lyin' Ted Cruz consistently said that he will and must win Indiana. If he doesn't he should drop out of the race-stop wasting time  money
05-03-2016 23:14:30,Thank you Indiana! #Trump2016#MakeAmericaGreatAgain 
05-03-2016 23:38:34,Thank you Indiana we were just projected to be the winner. We have won in every category. You are very special people-I will never forget!
05-04-2016 04:00:46,.@oreillyfactor  Please correct I WON Virginia!
05-04-2016 09:25:10,What a great evening we had. So interesting that Sanders beat Crooked Hillary. The dysfunctional system is totally rigged against him!
05-04-2016 09:44:28,I would rather run against Crooked Hillary Clinton than Bernie Sanders and that will happen because the books are cooked against Bernie!

05-05-2016 18:57:30,Happy #CincoDeMayo! The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics!  
05-05-2016 19:30:32,Bernie Sanders has been treated terribly by the Democrats—both with delegates  otherwise. He should show them  run as an Independent.
05-05-2016 23:28:31,Join me tomorrow! #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain Omaha Nebraska: Oregon:
05-06-2016 01:57:05,Can you believe Crooked Hillary said We are going to put a whole lot of coal minerscoal companies out of business. She then apologized.
05-06-2016 03:19:09,Thank you West Virginia. Let's keep it going. Go out and vote on Tuesday - we will win big. #Trump2016
05-06-2016 10:14:56,Unlike crooked Hillary Clinton who wants to destroy all miners I want wages to go up in America. We will do so by bringing back jobs!
05-06-2016 10:19:08,Governor Rick Perry said Donald Trump is one of the most talented people running for the Presidency I've ever seen. Thank you Rick!
05-06-2016 10:26:43,So many great endorsements yesterday except for Paul Ryan! We must put America first and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
05-06-2016 12:08:37,Paul Ryan said that I inherited something very special the Republican Party. Wrong I didn't inherit it I won it with millions of voters!
05-06-2016 12:38:38,Crooked Hillary has ZERO leadership ability. As Bernie Sanders says she has bad judgement. Constantly playing the women's card - it is sad!
05-06-2016 16:08:23,Thank you to teachers across America! When I become POTUS we will make education a far more important component of our life than it is now.
05-06-2016 18:03:34,Joe Scarborough initially endorsed Jeb Bush and Jeb crashed then John Kasich and that didn't work. Not much power or insight!
05-06-2016 18:25:27,I hear @JoeNBC of rapidly fading @Morning_Joe is pushing hard for a third party candidate to run. This will guarantee a Crooked Hillary win.
05-06-2016 21:01:44,Response to @LindseyGrahamSC:
05-06-2016 23:15:58,I hope corrupt Hillary Clinton chooses goofy Elizabeth Warren as her running mate. I will defeat them both.
05-06-2016 23:16:17,Let’s properly check goofy Elizabeth Warren’s records to see if she is Native American. I say she’s a fraud!
05-06-2016 23:16:36,Goofy Elizabeth Warren Hillary Clinton’s flunky has a career that is totally based on a lie. She is not Native American.
05-07-2016 00:14:54,Just met with courageous family of Sarah Root in Nebraska. Sarah was horribly killed by illegal immigrant but leaves behind amazing legacy.
05-07-2016 00:16:31,Crooked Hillary Clinton wants completely open borders. Millions of Democrats will run from her over this and support me.
05-07-2016 02:44:44,Goofy Elizabeth Warren and her phony Native American heritage are on a Twitter rant. She is too easy! I'm driving her nuts.
05-07-2016 02:44:54,Goofy Elizabeth Warren is weak and ineffective. Does nothing. All talk no action -- maybe her Native American name?
05-07-2016 15:36:17,Join me in Washington today!Spokane tickets: tickets: 
05-07-2016 15:47:00,I am going to keep our jobs in the U.S. and totally rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. Crooked Hillary has no clue! @Teamsters
05-07-2016 15:53:38,I am honored that the great men and women of the @Teamsters have created a movement from within called Teamsters for Trump! Thank you.
05-07-2016 17:46:46,Remember when the two failed presidential candidates Lindsey Graham and Jeb Bush signed a binding PLEDGE? They broke the deal no honor!

05-08-2016 20:15:20,Crooked Hillary just can't close the deal with Bernie. It will be the same way with ISIS and China on trade and Mexico at the border. Bad!
05-09-2016 02:04:03,On @seanhannity show @FoxNews now. ENJOY!
05-09-2016 09:32:05,I will win the election against Crooked Hillary despite the people in the Republican Party that are currently and selfishly opposed to me!
05-09-2016 09:34:48,I will be interviewed on @NewDay @CNN at 7:00 A.M.
05-09-2016 10:05:49,.@drmoore  Russell Moore is truly a terrible representative of Evangelicals and all of the good they stand for. A nasty guy with no heart!
05-09-2016 10:27:02,I will be interviewed on @CNN at 7:00 A.M.
05-09-2016 10:39:12,Wow I hear @Morning_Joe has gone really hostile ever since I said I won't do or watch the show anymore.They misrepresent my positions!

05-09-2016 16:56:36,Crooked Hillary Clinton says that she got more primary votes than Donald Trump. But I had 17 people to beat—she had one!
05-09-2016 16:57:46,If I only had 1 person running against me in the primaries like Hillary Clinton I would have gotten 10 million more votes than she did!
05-09-2016 16:59:00,I will have set the all time record in primary votes in the Republican party --despite having to compete against 17 other people!
05-09-2016 17:21:21,I am lowering taxes far more than any other candidate. Any negotiated increase by Congress to my proposal would still be lower than current!
05-09-2016 20:50:01,Thank you Jason Greenblatt @JasonDovEsq For Our Children: Let's Elect Donald Trump

05-10-2016 12:57:08,Why does the media with a strong push from Crooked Hillary keep pushing the false narrative that I want to raise taxes. Exactly opposite!
05-10-2016 13:57:33,It was Rosie O'Donnell who ate the cake in the vicious Hillary commercial about me not Crooked Hillary! @marthamaccallum
05-10-2016 14:03:51,It is only the people that were never asked to be VP that tell the press that they will not take the position.

05-11-2016 14:18:21,Goofy Elizabeth Warren has been one of the least effective Senators in the entire U.S. Senate. She has done nothing!
05-11-2016 17:12:06,Goofy Elizabeth Warren didn’t have the guts to run for POTUS. Her phony Native American heritage stops that and VP cold.

05-11-2016 19:18:11,If the people of Massachusetts found out what an ineffective Senator goofy Elizabeth Warren has been she would lose!
05-11-2016 19:37:51,Goofy Elizabeth Warren is now using the woman’s card like her friend crooked Hillary. See her dumb tweet “when a woman stands up to you…”
05-11-2016 20:03:35,Our Native American Senator goofy Elizabeth Warren couldn’t care less about the American worker…does nothing to help!
05-11-2016 20:22:28,Goofy Elizabeth Warren lied when she says I want to abolish the Federal Minimum Wage. See media—asking for increase!
05-11-2016 20:41:51,Isn’t it funny when a failed Senator like goofy Elizabeth Warren can spend a whole day tweeting about Trump  gets nothing done in Senate?
05-11-2016 20:51:20,In interview I told @AP that my taxes are under routine audit and I would release my tax returns when audit is complete not after election!
05-11-2016 21:07:02,If it were up to goofy Elizabeth Warren we’d have no jobs in America—she doesn’t have a clue.
05-12-2016 18:12:38,Great day in D.C. with @SpeakerRyan and Republican leadership. Things working out really well! #Trump2016

05-13-2016 02:32:52,Senator Lindsey Graham called me yesterday very much to my surprise and we had a very interesting talk about national security and more!
05-13-2016 18:40:19,.@thehill  Your story about me  the carbon tax is absolutely incorrect—it is just the opposite. I will not support or endorse a carbon tax!
05-13-2016 20:31:52,An incredible honor to receive the endorsement of a person Ihave such tremendous respect for. Thank you Sheldon! 
05-14-2016 01:03:02,If Crooked Hillary Clinton can't close the deal on Crazy Bernie how is she going to take on China Russia ISIS and all of the others?
05-14-2016 15:09:49,Great new poll- thank you! 
05-14-2016 15:16:06,Wow @CNN is really working hard to make me look as bad  as possible. Very unprofessional. Hurting in ratings - bad television!
05-15-2016 10:49:31,Thank you for the nice words this morning @KellyRiddell. Well delivered and totally logical! @CNN   @FoxNews
05-15-2016 10:55:39,The failing @nytimes wrote yet another hit piece on me. All are impressed with how nicely I have treated women they found nothing. A joke!
05-15-2016 11:13:17,Everyone is laughing at the @nytimes for the lame hit piece they did on me and women.I gave them many names of women I helped-refused to use
05-15-2016 11:32:14,Why doesn't the failing @nytimes write the real story on the Clintons and women? The media is TOTALLY dishonest!
05-15-2016 19:06:18,Wow I have had so many calls from high ranking people laughing at the stupidity of the failing @nytimes piece. Massive front page for that!
05-15-2016 19:11:30,Why did the failing @nytimes refuse to use any of the names given to them that I was so proud to have helped with their careers. DISHONEST!
05-15-2016 19:26:45,The media is really on a witch-hunt against me. False reporting and plenty of it - but we will prevail!
05-15-2016 21:26:39,Thank you Georgia! See you soon!#Trump2016 
05-16-2016 01:25:54,The @washingtonpost report on potential VP candidates is wrong. Marco Rubio and most others mentioned are NOT under consideration.
05-16-2016 02:23:06,Great new poll- thank you!#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 
05-16-2016 10:00:52,Bernie Sanders is being treated very badly by the Dems. The system is rigged against him. He should run as an independent! Run Bernie run.
05-16-2016 11:00:58,That was an amazing interview on @foxandfriends - I hope the rest of the media picks it up to show how totally dishonest the @nytimes is!
05-16-2016 13:09:26,The @nytimes is so dishonest. Their hit piece cover story on me yesterday was just blown up by Rowanne Brewer who said it was a lie!
05-16-2016 13:12:38,Wow Rowanne Brewer the most prominently depicted woman in the failing @nytimes story yesterday was on @foxandfriends saying Times lied
05-16-2016 13:24:21,A political commentator for @cnn which I no longer watch said Trump showed some weakness in the Repub Primaries. I set all-time record!
05-16-2016 15:25:02,With the coming forward today of the woman central to the failing @nytimes hit piece on me we have exposed the article as a fraud!
05-16-2016 18:19:42,Thank you Anthony @Scaramucci @WSJ The Entrepreneur's Case for Trump  
05-16-2016 21:50:40,Rowanne Brewer the most prominently depicted woman in the failing @nytimes story yesterday joined @foxandfriends. 
05-16-2016 22:12:53,The failing @nytimes is greatly embarrassed by the totally dishonest story they did on my relationship with women.
05-16-2016 22:13:20,No wonder the @nytimes is failing—who can believe what they write after the false malicious  libelous story they did on me.
05-16-2016 22:14:19,Over 50 women were interviewed by the @nytimes yet they only wrote about 6. That’s because there were so many positive statements.
05-16-2016 22:15:52,The writer of the now proven false story in the @nytimes Michael Barbaro who was interviewed on CBS this morning was unable to respond.
05-17-2016 01:08:17,In politics and in life ignorance is not a virtue. This is a primary reason that President Obama is the worst president in U.S. history!
05-17-2016 03:46:35,I gave a woman named Barbara Res a top N.Y. construction job when that was unheard of and now she is nasty. So much for a nice thank you!
05-17-2016 04:02:45,What Barbara Res does not say is that she would call my company endlessly and for years trying to come back. I said no.
05-17-2016 11:29:09,Wow 30000 e-mails were deleted by Crooked Hillary Clinton. She said they had to do with a wedding reception. Liar! How can she run?
05-17-2016 11:37:03,The pathetic new hit ad against me misrepresents the final line. You can tell them to go BLANK themselves - was about China NOT WOMEN!
05-17-2016 11:46:22,Crooked Hillary Clinton put out an ad where I am misquoted on women. Can't believe she would misrepresent the facts! My hit was on China
05-17-2016 11:52:00,Oregon is voting today. Keep the big numbers going - VOTE TRUMP! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
05-17-2016 11:58:10,Amazing that Crooked Hillary can do a hit ad on me concerning women when her husband was the WORST abuser of woman in U.S. political history
05-17-2016 12:31:53,Crooked Hillary can't close the deal with Bernie Sanders. Will be another bad day for her!

05-17-2016 23:42:33,Wall Street paid for ad is a fraud just like Crooked Hillary! Their main line had nothing to do with women and they knew it. Apologize?

05-18-2016 01:49:32,I can't believe that @CNN would allow the very nice Jeffrey Lord to be savaged by a panel of seven Trump haters. 7 to 1 - Don't watch CNN!
05-18-2016 01:53:58,I look so forward to debating Crooked Hillary Clinton! Democrat Primaries are rigged e-mail investigation is rigged - so time to get it on!
05-18-2016 02:38:07,Michael Barbaro the author of the now discredited @nytimes hit piece on me with women has in past tweeted badly about me. He should resign
05-18-2016 03:15:07,Thank you Oregon! #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 
05-18-2016 03:24:48,Congratulations to THE MOVEMENT we have just won THE GREAT STATE OF OREGON. The vote percentage is even higher than anticipated! Thank you.
05-18-2016 04:22:01,Paul Begala the dopey @CNN flunky and head of the Pro-Hillary Clinton Super PAC has knowingly committed fraud in his first ad against me.
05-18-2016 11:20:19,Bernie Sanders is being treated very badly by the Democrats - the system is rigged against him. Many of his disenfranchised fans are for me!
05-18-2016 16:39:07,Why did Clinton supporter @AlisonForKY declare Crooked Hillary winner in KY when AP hasn't even called the race?
05-18-2016 17:38:20,Thank you Arizona! See you soon!#MakeAmericaGreatAgain

05-19-2016 01:54:08,Some low-life journalist claims that I made a pass at her 29 years ago. Never happened! Like the @nytimes story which has become a joke!
05-19-2016 02:52:29,My list of potential U.S. Supreme Court Justices was very well recieved. During the next number of weeks I may be adding to the list!
05-19-2016 10:27:48,Looks like yet another terrorist attack. Airplane departed from Paris. When will we get tough smart and vigilant? Great hate and sickness!
05-19-2016 17:29:36,How quality a woman is Rowanne Brewer Lane to have exposed the @nytimes as a disgusting fraud?  Thank you Rowanne.
05-19-2016 19:36:58,Thank you @LtStevenLRogers. We will respond to terrorism with strength in 2017!
05-20-2016 09:40:37,I said that Crooked Hillary Clinton is not qualified to be president because she has very bad judgement - Bernie said the same thing!
05-20-2016 09:47:09,Crooked Hillary has zero imagination and even less stamina. ISIS China Russia and all would love for her to be president. 4 more years!
05-20-2016 09:58:47,Look where the world is today a total mess and ISIS is still running around wild. I can fix it fast Hillary has no chance!
05-20-2016 10:08:49,Crooked Hillary Clinton looks presidential? I don't think so! Four more years of Obama and our country will never come back. ISIS LAUGHS!
05-20-2016 10:26:20,Crooked Hillary can't even close the deal with Bernie - and the Dems have it rigged in favor of Hillary. Four more years of this? No way!

05-20-2016 16:09:16,Thanks @piersmorgan! Trump is the most unpredictable extraordinary entertainingmassively popular candidate this country has ever seen.
05-20-2016 16:11:21,Failing @NYTimes will always take a good story about me and make it bad. Every article is unfair and biased. Very sad!
05-20-2016 20:06:48,Thank you! An honor to be the first candidate ever endorsed by the @NRA- prior to @GOPconvention! #Trump2016 #2A  
05-20-2016 21:55:40,Great day in Kentucky with Wayne LaPierre Chris Cox  the @NRA! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016

05-20-2016 23:36:17,@montgomeriefdn  Colin great to have you at Trump Turnberry. So proud of you and your GREAT playing! You made winning MAJORS look easy!
05-21-2016 00:44:43,Thank you @TheTodaysGolfer for the wonderful statement that the new par 3 9th hole @Trump Turnberry could be the most dramatic in Britain.
05-21-2016 01:51:57,Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to essentially abolish the 2nd Amendment. No gun owner can ever vote for Clinton!
05-21-2016 01:56:44,Crooked Hillary is spending tremendous amounts of Wall Street money on false ads against me. She is a very dishonest person!
05-21-2016 10:56:20,While our wonderful president was out playing golf all day the TSA is falling apart just like our government! Airports a total disaster!
05-21-2016 12:49:59,Crooked Hillary wants to get rid of all guns and yet she is surrounded by bodyguards who are fully armed. No more guns to protect Hillary!
05-21-2016 16:08:26,.@CNN is so negative getting even worse as I get closer. Just had two anti-Trump losers with zero rebuttal from my team. Turning off!
05-21-2016 17:00:42,MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 
05-21-2016 17:02:41,Crooked Hillary Clintons foreign interventions unleashed ISIS in Syria Iraq and Libya. She is reckless and dangerous!
05-21-2016 20:13:08,Thank you to all of the men and women who have served our country. You are our true heroes! #ArmedForcesDay 
05-22-2016 03:55:39,Crooked Hillary said that I  want guns brought into the school classroom. Wrong!
05-22-2016 12:47:48,Hillary Clinton is not qualified to be president because her judgement has been proven to be so bad! Would be four more years of stupidity!
05-22-2016 14:47:45,Why do the networks continue to put dopey @BillKristol on panels when he has called every single shot about me wrong for 2 yrs?
05-22-2016 19:37:05,How can Crooked Hillary say she cares about women when she is silent on radical Islam which horribly oppresses women?
05-22-2016 19:38:18,Crooked Hillary wants a radical 500% increase in Syrian refugees. We can’t allow this. Time to get smart and protect America!
05-22-2016 19:46:57,Join me on Wednesday May 25th at the Anaheim Convention Center!#Trump2016 #MAGA Tickets:  
05-22-2016 20:32:33,Bernie Sanders is continuing his quest because he believes that Crooked Hillary Clinton will be forced out of the race - e-mail scandal!
05-22-2016 20:44:48,The American people are sick and tired of not being able to lead normal lives and to constantly be on the lookout for terror and terrorists!
05-22-2016 22:54:48,Thank you America! #Trump2016 
05-23-2016 13:46:57,In trade military and EVERYTHING else it will be AMERICA FIRST! This will quickly lead to our ultimate goal: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
05-23-2016 15:32:11,Is Hillary really protecting women? 
05-23-2016 17:15:20,Obama’s VA Secretary just said we shouldn't measurewait times. Hillary says VA problems are not ‘widespread.’ I will take care ofour vets!
05-23-2016 23:42:39,I will be interviewed on @oreillyfactor at 8:00 P.M. Enjoy!
05-24-2016 00:25:41,Join me in California or Montana!5/25/16: Anaheim California/26/16: Billings Montana
05-24-2016 02:38:48,While under no obligation to do so I have raised between 5  6 million dollars including 1million dollars from me for our VETERANS. Nice!
05-24-2016 02:46:08,Much of the money I have raised for our veterans has already been distributed with the rest to go shortly to various other veteran groups.
05-24-2016 02:50:48,Amazingly with all of the money I have raised for the vets I have got nothing but bad publicity from the dishonest and disgusting media.
05-24-2016 10:41:44,I just released my financial disclosure forms the largest numbers in the history of the F.E.C. Even the dishonest media thinks great!
05-24-2016 11:42:35,Crooked Hillary Clinton overregulates overtaxes and doesn't care about jobs. Most importantly she suffers from plain old bad judgement!
05-24-2016 14:35:32,A great new book has been written about Crooked Hillary. Read it  you will never be able to vote for her. @Ed_Klein 
05-24-2016 15:03:39,A wonderfully written article concerning Israel by @JasonDovEsq 
05-24-2016 15:09:24,A suggestion for the dishonest media- 
05-24-2016 21:00:07,Thank you @DailyMail- for setting the failing @NYTimes story straight. This is what the NYT's should have written! 
05-25-2016 00:32:47,After raising w/ no obligation almost $6M for Vets I couldn't believe protesters formed @ Trump Tower. JUST OUT- SENT BY CROOKED HILLARY!
05-25-2016 00:33:27,Great honor to receive today's endorsement of @RickSantorum. Really nice! #Trump2016

05-25-2016 05:37:29,@elizabethforma Goofy Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to as Pocahontas because she faked the fact she is native American is a lowlife!
05-25-2016 12:17:40,@elizabethforma  Goofy Elizabeth Warren sometimes known as Pocahontas bought foreclosed housing and made a quick killing. Total hypocrite!
05-25-2016 12:31:56,Goofy Senator Elizabeth Warren @elizabethforma has done less in the U.S. Senate than practically any other senator. All talk no action!
05-25-2016 13:14:58,Crooked Hillary Clinton just can't close the deal with Bernie. I had to knock out 16 very good and smart candidates. Hillary doesn't have it
05-25-2016 13:39:38,The protesters in New Mexico were thugs who were flying the Mexican flag. The rally inside was big and beautiful but outside criminals!
05-25-2016 18:42:55,Thank you Washington! Honored to say on behalf of our great movement we have broken the all time record for votes in GOP primary history.
05-25-2016 23:18:54,Thank you Anaheim California!#Trump2016 
05-26-2016 13:18:27,The Inspector General's report on Crooked Hillary Clinton is a disaster. Such bad judgement and temperament cannot be allowed in the W.H.
05-26-2016 16:35:00,.@kimguilfoyle- just watched you on @OutnumberedFNC- thank you!
05-26-2016 18:59:12,Thank you Mr.  Mrs. @TomBarrackJr for the wonderful and magical evening last night. It will not be forgotten. #Trump2016
05-26-2016 21:15:16,I find it offensive that Goofy Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to as Pocahontas pretended to be Native American to get in Harvard.

05-28-2016 04:13:54,Obama administration fails to screen Syrian refugees' social media accounts:
05-28-2016 06:19:54,Great rally in Fresno California- great crowd! Thank you! #Trump2016 
05-28-2016 13:47:10,The U.S. has 69 treaties with other countries where we would have to defend them and their borders. How nice but what do we get? NOT ENOUGH
05-28-2016 14:47:16,I (we) broke the all-time record for most votes gotten in a Republican Primary - by a lot - and with many states left to go! Thank you.
05-28-2016 20:28:22,The failing @nytimes wrote a story about my management style  that I don't have many people. I have 73 Hillary has 800-  I'm beating her.
05-28-2016 20:28:40,The media is on a new phony kick about my management style. I spend much less money  get much better results! What we need as Prez!
05-28-2016 20:28:48,I am always on the front page of the failing @nytimes but when I won the GOP nomination I'm in the back of the paper. Very dishonest!
05-28-2016 21:33:58,Don't believe the biased and phony media quoting people who work for my campaign. The only quote that matters is a quote from me!
05-28-2016 21:34:55,Does President Obama ever discuss the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor while he's in Japan? Thousands of American lives lost. #MDW
05-29-2016 11:04:47,Honor Memorial Day by thinking of and respecting all of the great men and women that gave their lives for us and our country! We love them.
05-29-2016 16:45:44,Heading to D.C. to see and hear ROLLING THUNDER. Amazing people that LOVE OUR COUNTRY. Great spirit!
05-29-2016 21:43:15,Good news is that my campaign has perhaps more cash than any campaign in the history of politics- b/c I stand 100% behind everything we do.
05-29-2016 22:53:16,Bill Kristol has been wrong for 2yrs-an embarrassed loser but if the GOP can't control their own then they are not a party. Be tough R's!
05-29-2016 22:58:27,The Republican Party has to be smart  strong if it wants to win in November. Can't allow lightweights to set up a spoiler Indie candidate!
05-29-2016 23:02:01,If dummy Bill Kristol actually does get a spoiler to run as an Independent say good bye to the Supreme Court!
05-30-2016 10:41:49,Obama says a WALL at our southern border won't enhance our security (wrong) and yet he now wants to build a much bigger wall (fence) at W.H.
05-30-2016 11:00:47,In getting the endorsement of the 16500 Border Patrol Agents (thank you) the statement was made that the WALL was very necessary!
05-30-2016 11:05:34,The endorsement of me by the 16500 Border Patrol Agents was the first time that they ever endorsed a presidential candidate. Nice!
05-30-2016 11:26:47,Have a great Memorial Day and remember that we will soon MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
05-30-2016 20:13:17,I would have had millions of votes more in the primaries (than Crooked Hillary) if I only had one opponent instead of sixteen. Broke record
05-30-2016 20:15:04,I hope everyone had a great Memorial Day!
05-30-2016 21:45:09,I have a judge in the Trump University civil case Gonzalo Curiel (San Diego) who is very unfair. An Obama pick. Totally biased-hates Trump
05-30-2016 21:55:41,I should have easily won the Trump University case on summary judgement but have a judge Gonzalo Curiel who is totally biased against me.
05-31-2016 10:48:49,So many great things happening - new poll numbers looking good! News conference at 11:00 A.M. today Trump Tower!
05-31-2016 11:42:20,I have raised/given a tremendous amount of money to our great VETERANS and have got nothing but bad publicity for doing so. Watch!
05-31-2016 16:53:58,Just finished a press conference in Trump Tower wherein I gave information on which VETERANS groups got the $5600000 that I raised/gave!
05-31-2016 16:57:17,So many veterans groups are beyond happy with all of the money I raised/gave! It was my great honor - they do an amazing job.
05-31-2016 21:12:07,Join me in Sacramento California-tomorrow evening @ 7pm! #Trump2016

05-31-2016 23:14:42,Katie Couric the third rate reporter who has been largely forgotten should be ashamed of herself for the fraudulent editing of her doc.
05-31-2016 23:17:33,I am getting great credit for my press conference today. Crooked Hillary should be admonished for not having a press conference in 179 days.
05-31-2016 23:18:28,Congratulations to @seanhannity on his tremendous increase in television ratings. Speaking of ratings- I will be on his show tonight @ 10pE.
06-01-2016 13:17:58,So I raised/gave $5600000 for the veterans and the media makes me look bad! They do anything to belittle - totally biased.

06-01-2016 22:16:36,Crooked Hillary Clinton is a fraud who has put the public and country at risk by her illegal and very stupid use of e-mails. Many missing!

06-02-2016 04:58:34,Thank you Sacramento California! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 
06-02-2016 15:03:21,Crooked Hillary Clinton has zero natural talent - she should not be president. Her temperament is bad and her decision making ability-zilch!
06-02-2016 15:10:22,Bernie Sanders was right when he said that Crooked Hillary Clinton was not qualified to be president because she suffers from BAD judgement!
06-02-2016 15:57:14,Do you ever notice that @CNN gives me very little proper representation on my policies. Just watched-nobody knew anything about my foreign P
06-02-2016 16:31:52,Wow USA Today did todays cover story on my record in lawsuits. Verdict: 450 wins 38 losses. Isn't that what you want for your president?

06-02-2016 16:48:50,With all of the Crooked Hillary Clinton's foreign policy experience she has made so many mistakes - and I mean real monsters! No more HRC.
06-02-2016 16:54:21,Even though I have a very biased and unfair judge in the Trump U civil case in San Diego I have thousands of great reviews  will win case!
06-02-2016 17:02:38,After the litigation is disposed of and the case won I have instructed my execs to open Trump U(?) so much interest in it! I will be pres.
06-02-2016 17:06:29,Crooked Hillary Clinton who I would love to call Lyin' Hillary is getting ready to totally misrepresent my foreign policy positions.
06-02-2016 19:15:33,Crooked Hillary no longer has credibility - too much failure in office. People will not allow another four years of incompetence!
06-02-2016 19:18:14,Bad performance by Crooked Hillary Clinton! Reading poorly from the telepromter! She doesn't even look presidential!
06-02-2016 21:12:54,So great to have the endorsement and support of Paul Ryan. We will both be working very hard to Make America Great Again!
06-02-2016 22:16:50,A 60% increase in Texas Blue Cross/Blue Shield through ObamaCare. I told you so there is panic and anger as healthcare costs explode!

06-03-2016 12:43:51,Rally last night in San Jose was great. Tremendous love and enthusiasm in the hall. Big crowd. Outside small group of thugs burned Am flag!
06-03-2016 13:05:53,I don't watch or do @Morning_Joe anymore. Small audience low ratings! I hear Mika has gone wild with hate. Joe is Joe. They lost their way!
06-03-2016 13:13:50,In Crooked Hillary's telepromter speech yesterday she made up things that I said or believe but have no basis in fact. Not honest!
06-03-2016 16:01:47,I'm a former chief of police in a border town. I'm Hispanic I'm proud to be Hispanic and I'm 100% behind Trump.
06-03-2016 19:03:17,So much interest in my visit to Scotland! I greatly look forward to attending the opening event @TrumpTurnberry- taking place on June 24th.

06-04-2016 04:29:03,Muhammad Ali is dead at 74! A truly great champion and a wonderful guy. He will be missed by all!
06-04-2016 13:04:33,Many of the thugs that attacked the peaceful Trump supporters in San Jose were illegals. They burned the American flag and laughed at police
06-04-2016 13:11:09,The Mayor of San Jose did a terrible job of ordering the  protection of innocent people. The thugs were lucky supporters remained peaceful!
06-04-2016 13:14:26,We just had the worst jobs report since 2010.
06-04-2016 21:24:13,Thank you Attorney General Gonzales so many people feel this way. 
06-05-2016 21:36:48,The Clinton News Network sometimes referred to as @CNN is getting more and more biased.They act so indignant-hear them behind closed doors
06-05-2016 21:56:01,I am watching @CNN very little lately because they are so biased against me. Shows are predictable garbage! CNN and MSM is one big lie!
06-05-2016 22:15:01,Hillary Clinton is unfit to be president. She has bad judgement poor leadership skills and a very bad and destructive track record. Change!
06-06-2016 11:23:54,People like @KatyTurNBC report on my campaign but have zero access. They say what they want without any knowledge.True of so much of media!
06-06-2016 12:56:07,Just like I have been able to spend far less money than  others on the campaign and finish #1 so too should our country. We can be great!
06-06-2016 13:15:19,Crooked Hillary Clinton has not held a news conference in more than 7 months. Her record is so bad she is unable to answer tough questions!

06-19-2016 03:01:15,Yesterday's failing @NYTimes fraudulently shows an empty room prior to my speech when in fact it was packed!

06-20-2016 10:24:12,When I said that if within the Orlando club you had some people with guns I was obviously talking about additional guards or employees
06-21-2016 10:38:49,Crooked Hillary Clinton is totally unfit to be our president-really bad judgement and a temperament according to new book which is a mess!
06-21-2016 14:22:08,I will be making a big speech tomorrow to discuss the failed policies and bad judgment of Crooked Hillary Clinton.
06-21-2016 16:36:40,Hillary says this election is about judgment.  She's right.  Her judgement has killed thousands unleashed ISIS and wrecked the economy.
06-21-2016 16:38:07,Hillary Clinton surged the trade deficit with China 40% asSecretary of State costing Americans millions of jobs.
06-21-2016 16:42:47,How can Hillary run the economy when she can't even send emails without putting entire nation at risk?
06-21-2016 16:44:28,Hillary Clinton's open borders immigration policies will drive down wages for all Americans - and make everyone less safe.
06-21-2016 16:53:07,Obama-Clinton inherited $10T in debt and turned it into nearly $20T.  They have bankrupted… 
06-21-2016 16:55:41,I am the king of debt.That has been great for me as a businessman but is bad for the country. I made a fortune off of debt will fix U.S.
06-21-2016 17:16:14,Hillary took money and did favors for regimes that enslave women and murder gays.
06-21-2016 17:17:49,If you want to know about Hillary Clinton's honesty  judgment ask the family of Ambassador Stevens.
06-21-2016 17:19:22,Hillary defrauded America as Secy of State. She used it as a personal hedge fund to get herself rich! Corrupt dangerous dishonest.
06-21-2016 20:44:00,I will be interviewed by @LouDobbs tonight on @FoxBusiness 7pm ET
06-22-2016 03:16:27,Crooked Hillary refuses to say that she will be raising taxes beyond belief! She will be a disaster for jobs and the economy!
06-22-2016 19:00:47,Hillary says things can't change. I say they have to change. It's a choice between Americanism and her corrupt globalism. #Imwithyou

10-16-2016 13:15:03,A country that Crooked Hillary says has funded ISIS also gave Wild Bill $1 million for his birthday? SO CORRUPT! 
10-16-2016 16:07:08,Hillary's staff thought her email scandal might just blow over. Who would trust these people with national security? 
10-16-2016 16:07:58,We've all wondered how Hillary avoided prosecution for her email scheme. Wikileaks may have found the answer. Obama! 
10-16-2016 17:01:12,The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary - but also at many polling places - SAD

11-15-2016 13:40:29,The Electoral College is actually genius in that it brings all states including the smaller ones into play. Campaigning is much different!

11-22-2016 11:31:18,Perhaps a new meeting will be set up with the @nytimes. In the meantime they continue to cover me inaccurately and with a nasty tone!
11-22-2016 11:36:46,The failing @nytimes just announced that complaints about them are at a 15 year high. I can fully understand that - but why announce?

11-27-2016 03:59:52,The Democrats when they incorrectly thought they were going to win asked that the election night tabulation be accepted. Not so anymore!
11-27-2016 12:19:31,Hillary Clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in. Nothing will change
11-27-2016 20:30:43,In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally
11-27-2016 20:34:18,It would have been much easier for me to win the so-called popular vote than the Electoral College in that I would only campaign in 3 or 4--
11-27-2016 20:41:32,states instead of the 15 states that I visited. I would have won even more easily and convincingly (but smaller states are forgotten)!

11-29-2016 03:03:59,.@CNN is so embarrassed by their total  (100%) support of Hillary Clinton and yet her loss in a landslide that they don't know what to do.
11-29-2016 11:15:49,The Great State of Michigan was just certified as a Trump WIN giving all of our MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN supporters another victory - 306!
11-29-2016 11:34:42,I thought that @CNN would get better after they failed so badly in their support of Hillary Clinton however since election they are worse!
11-29-2016 11:55:13,Nobody should be allowed to burn the American flag - if they do there must be consequences - perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail!

06-22-2017 13:18:09,Former Homeland Security Advisor Jeh Johnson is latest top intelligence official to state there was no grand scheme between Trump  Russia.
06-22-2017 13:22:04,By the way if Russia was working so hard on the 2016 Election it all took place during the Obama Admin. Why didn't they stop them?
06-22-2017 14:01:10,...Why did Democratic National Committee turn down the DHS offer to protect against hacks (long prior to election). It's all a big Dem HOAX!
06-22-2017 14:08:50,...Why did the DNC REFUSE to turn over its Server to the FBI and still hasn't? It's all a big Dem scam and excuse for losing the election!
06-22-2017 14:15:48,I certainly hope the Democrats do not force Nancy P out. That would be very bad for the Republican Party - and please let Cryin' Chuck stay!
06-22-2017 16:54:50,With all of the recently reported electronic surveillance intercepts unmasking and illegal leaking of information I have no idea...

06-23-2017 21:32:29,WEEKLY ADDRESS🇺🇸 
06-24-2017 00:43:48,Just out: The Obama Administration knew far in advance of November 8th about election meddling by Russia. Did nothing about it. WHY?
06-24-2017 12:51:33,Democrats slam GOP healthcare proposal as Obamacare premiums  deductibles increase by over 100%. Remember keep your doctor keep your plan?
06-24-2017 20:28:46,Since the Obama Administration was told way before the 2016 Election that the Russians were meddling why no action? Focus on them not T!
06-24-2017 20:44:36,Obama Administration official said they choked when it came to acting on Russian meddling of election. They didn't want to hurt Hillary?
06-24-2017 20:50:56,I cannot imagine that these very fine Republican Senators would allow the American people to suffer a broken ObamaCare any longer!
06-24-2017 21:23:52,MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
06-25-2017 12:00:37,Hillary Clinton colluded with the Democratic Party in order to beat Crazy Bernie Sanders. Is she allowed to so collude? Unfair to Bernie!
06-25-2017 12:07:41,I am on @foxandfriends - Enjoy!
06-26-2017 12:30:12,The Democrats have become nothing but OBSTRUCTIONISTS they have no policies or ideas. All they do is delay and complain.They own ObamaCare!
06-26-2017 12:37:16,The reason that President Obama did NOTHING about Russia after being notified by the CIA of meddling is that he expected Clinton would win..
06-26-2017 12:50:15,...and did not want to rock the boat. He didn't choke he colluded or obstructed and it did the Dems and Crooked Hillary no good.
06-26-2017 12:59:31,The real story is that President Obama did NOTHING after being informed in August about Russian meddling. With 4 months looking at Russia...
06-26-2017 13:05:01,..under a magnifying glass they have zero tapes of T people colluding. There is no collusion  no obstruction. I should be given apology!
06-26-2017 13:14:24,Republican Senators are working very hard to get there with no help from the Democrats. Not easy! Perhaps just let OCare crash  burn!
06-26-2017 18:25:18,Very grateful for the 9-O decision from the U. S. Supreme Court. We must keep America SAFE!
06-27-2017 02:24:30,From @FoxNews Bombshell: In 2016 Obama dismissed idea that anyone could rig an American election.  Check out his statement - Witch Hunt!

06-27-2017 22:22:55,With ZERO Democrats to help and a failed expensive and dangerous ObamaCare as the Dems legacy the Republican Senators are working hard!
06-27-2017 22:27:48,I just finished a great meeting with the Republican Senators concerning HealthCare. They really want to get it right unlike OCare!
06-28-2017 10:49:22,The failing @nytimes writes false story after false story about me. They don't even call to verify the facts of a story. A Fake News Joke!

09-24-2017 11:13:11,...NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes but many stay away because they love our country. League should back U.S.
09-24-2017 18:20:35,Great solidarity for our National Anthem and for our Country. Standing with locked arms is good kneeling is not acceptable. Bad ratings!

09-24-2017 22:25:20,Sports fans should never condone players that do not stand proud for their National Anthem or their Country. NFL should change policy!

09-25-2017 11:25:25,So proud of NASCAR and its supporters and fans. They won't put up with disrespecting our Country or our Flag - they said it loud and clear!
09-25-2017 11:31:43,Many people booed the players who kneeled yesterday (which was a small percentage of total). These are fans who demand respect for our Flag!
09-25-2017 11:39:03,The issue of kneeling has nothing to do with race. It is about respect for our Country Flag and National Anthem. NFL must respect this!
09-25-2017 11:44:05,The White House never looked more beautiful than it did returning last night. Important meetings taking place today. Big tax cuts  reform.

09-25-2017 22:26:30,.@CNN is #FakeNews. Just reported COS (John Kelly) was opposed to my stance on NFL players disrespecting FLAG ANTHEM COUNTRY. Total lie!
09-25-2017 22:28:02,General John Kelly totally agrees w/ my stance on NFL players and the fact that they should not be disrespecting our FLAG or GREAT COUNTRY!
09-25-2017 22:29:18,Tremendous backlash against the NFL and its players for disrespect of our Country.#StandForOurAnthem🇺🇸
09-26-2017 00:45:48,Texas  Florida are doing great but Puerto Rico which was already suffering from broken infrastructure  massive debt is in deep trouble..

09-26-2017 10:35:43,The booing at the NFL football game last night when the entire Dallas team dropped to its knees was loudest I have ever heard. Great anger

09-26-2017 13:06:05,The NFL has all sorts of rules and regulations. The only way out for them is to set a rule that you can't kneel during our National Anthem!

09-27-2017 13:36:24,Facebook was always anti-Trump.The Networks were always anti-Trump henceFake News @nytimes(apologized)  @WaPo were anti-Trump. Collusion?
09-27-2017 13:41:25,..But the people were Pro-Trump! Virtually no President has accomplished what we have accomplished in the first 9 months-and economy roaring

09-28-2017 11:55:48,Democrats don't want massive tax cuts - how does that win elections? Great reviews for Tax Cut and Reform Bill.
09-28-2017 14:01:16,The electric power grid in Puerto Rico is totally shot. Large numbers of generators are now on Island. Food and water on site.
09-28-2017 19:39:13,Welcome back @SteveScalise!#TeamScalise 
09-28-2017 23:41:58,FEMA  First Responders are doing a GREAT job in Puerto Rico. Massive food  water delivered. Docks  electric grid dead. Locals trying....
09-28-2017 23:45:24,...really hard to help but many have lost their homes. Military is now on site and I will be there Tuesday. Wish press would treat fairly!
09-29-2017 00:03:09,Puerto Rico is devastated. Phone system electric grid many roads gone. FEMA and First Responders are amazing. Governor said great job!
09-29-2017 02:22:36,GDP was revised upward to 3.1 for last quarter. Many people thought it would be years before that happened. We have just begun!
11-30-2017 02:23:14,Funny to hear the Democrats talking about the National Debt when President Obama doubled it in only 8 years!
11-30-2017 12:01:25,The Failing @nytimes the pipe organ for the Democrat Party has become a virtual lobbyist for them with regard to our massive Tax Cut Bill. They are wrong so often that now I know we have a winner!
11-30-2017 12:15:08,The Failing @nytimes has totally gone against the Social Media Guidelines that they installed to preserve some credibility after many of their biased reporters went Rogue!  @foxandfriends
11-30-2017 12:25:00,The Chinese Envoy who just returned from North Korea seems to have had no impact on Little Rocket Man. Hard to believe his people and the military put up with living in such horrible conditions. Russia and China condemned the launch.
11-30-2017 13:05:21,Stock Market hits new Record High. Confidence and enthusiasm abound. More great numbers coming out!
11-30-2017 15:46:39,The Dow just broke 24000 for the first time (another all-time Record). If the Dems had won the Presidential Election the Market would be down 50% from these levels and Consumer Confidence which is also at an all-time high would be “low and glum!”
11-30-2017 19:26:42,Thank you @SenOrrinHatch. Let’s continue MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  
11-30-2017 21:50:33,Our FIFTH 1K milestone of 2017!#DOW24K #MAGA 
12-01-2017 00:42:21,The Christmas Story begins 2000 years ago with a mother a father their baby son and the most extraordinary gift of all—the gift of God’s love for all of humanity.Whatever our beliefs we know that the birth of Jesus Christ and the story of his life... 
12-01-2017 03:30:42,A disgraceful verdict in the Kate Steinle case! No wonder the people of our Country are so angry with Illegal Immigration.
12-01-2017 11:03:35,The Kate Steinle killer came back and back over the weakly protected Obama border always committing crimes and being violent and yet this info was not used in court. His exoneration is a complete travesty of justice. BUILD THE WALL!
12-01-2017 11:13:35,The jury was not told the killer of Kate was a 7 time felon. The Schumer/Pelosi Democrats are so weak on Crime that they will pay a big price in the 2018 and 2020 Elections.
12-01-2017 11:21:06,Republicans Senators are working hard to pass the biggest Tax Cuts in the history of our Country. The Bill is getting better and better. This is a once in a generation chance. Obstructionist Dems trying to block because they think it is too good and will not be given the credit!
12-01-2017 20:08:22,The media has been speculating that I fired Rex Tillerson or that he would be leaving soon - FAKE NEWS! He’s not leaving and while we disagree on certain subjects (I call the final shots) we work well together and America is highly respected again!
12-01-2017 21:49:27,Economists on the TAX CUTS and JOBS ACT:“The enactment of a comprehensive overhaul - complete with a lower corporate tax rate - will IGNITE our ECONOMY with levels of GROWTH not SEEN IN GENERATIONS...” 
12-02-2017 12:54:37,Biggest Tax Bill and Tax Cuts in history just passed in the Senate. Now these great Republicans will be going for final passage. Thank you to House and Senate Republicans for your hard work and commitment!
12-02-2017 17:14:13,I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!
12-02-2017 21:07:59,62 years ago this week a brave seamstress in Montgomery Alabama uttered one word that changed history... 
12-03-2017 01:50:15,Great job First Lady Melania! 
12-03-2017 02:06:54,So General Flynn lies to the FBI and his life is destroyed while Crooked Hillary Clinton on that now famous FBI holiday “interrogation” with no swearing in and no recording lies many times...and nothing happens to her? Rigged system or just a double standard?
12-03-2017 02:13:28,Many people in our Country are asking what the “Justice” Department is going to do about the fact that totally Crooked Hillary AFTER receiving a subpoena from the United States Congress deleted and “acid washed” 33000 Emails? No justice!
12-03-2017 02:22:40,Congratulations to @ABC News for suspending Brian Ross for his horrendously inaccurate and dishonest report on the Russia Russia Russia Witch Hunt. More Networks and “papers” should do the same with their Fake News!
12-03-2017 11:15:02,I never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn. Just more Fake News covering another Comey lie!
12-03-2017 12:27:54,Such a total miscarriage of Justice in San Francisco! 
12-03-2017 12:42:47,Tainted (no very dishonest?) FBI “agent’s role in Clinton probe under review.” Led Clinton Email probe. @foxandfriends  Clinton money going to wife of another FBI agent in charge.
12-03-2017 13:00:47,After years of Comey with the phony and dishonest Clinton investigation (and more) running the FBI its reputation is in Tatters - worst in History! But fear not we will bring it back to greatness.
12-03-2017 13:15:21,People who lost money when the Stock Market went down 350 points based on the False and Dishonest reporting of Brian Ross of @ABC News (he has been suspended) should consider hiring a lawyer and suing ABC for the damages this bad reporting has caused - many millions of dollars!
12-03-2017 13:36:45,Report: “ANTI-TRUMP FBI AGENT LED CLINTON EMAIL PROBE”  Now it all starts to make sense!
12-04-2017 11:17:05,Democrats refusal to give even one vote for massive Tax Cuts is why we need Republican Roy Moore to win in Alabama. We need his vote on stopping crime illegal immigration Border Wall Military Pro Life V.A. Judges 2nd Amendment and more. No to Jones a Pelosi/Schumer Puppet!
12-04-2017 12:00:08,Putting Pelosi/Schumer Liberal Puppet Jones into office in Alabama would hurt our great Republican Agenda of low on taxes tough on crime strong on military and borders... so much more. Look at your 401-k’s since Election. Highest Stock Market EVER! Jobs are roaring back!
12-04-2017 12:03:18,With the great vote on Cutting Taxes this could be a big day for the Stock Market - and YOU!
12-04-2017 12:35:39,A must watch: Legal Scholar Alan Dershowitz was just on @foxandfriends talking of what is going on with respect to the greatest Witch Hunt in U.S. political history. Enjoy!

12-07-2017 13:08:02,Go get the new book on Andrew Jackson by Brian Kilmeade...Really good. @foxandfriends

12-07-2017 16:16:19,Today our entire nation pauses to REMEMBER PEARL HARBOR—and the brave warriors who on that day stood tall and fought for America. God Bless our HEROES who wear the uniform and God Bless the United States of America. #PearlHarborRemembranceDay🇺🇸 
12-07-2017 20:04:20,Today the U.S. flag flies at half-staff at the @WhiteHouse in honor of National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day.  
12-07-2017 21:10:28,Across the battlefields oceans and harrowing skies of Europe and the Pacific throughout the war one great battle cry could be heard by America’s friends and foes alike:“REMEMBER PEARL HARBOR.” 
12-08-2017 05:36:09,Tonight @FLOTUS Melania and I were thrilled to welcome so many wonderful friends to the @WhiteHouse – and wish them all a very #HappyHanukkah 
12-08-2017 05:41:08,I fulfilled my campaign promise - others didn’t! 
12-08-2017 13:11:43,Big crowd expected today in Pensacola Florida for a Make America Great Again speech. We have done so much in so short a period of time...and yet are planning to do so much more! See you there!
12-08-2017 15:06:55,LAST thing the Make America Great Again Agenda needs is a Liberal Democrat in Senate where we have so little margin for victory already. The Pelosi/Schumer Puppet Jones would vote against us 100% of the time. He’s bad on Crime Life Border Vets Guns  Military. VOTE ROY MOORE!
12-08-2017 15:18:27,Fines and penalties against Wells Fargo Bank for their bad acts against their customers and others will not be dropped as has incorrectly been reported but will be pursued and if anything substantially increased. I will cut Regs but make penalties severe when caught cheating!
12-08-2017 17:46:21,MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 
12-08-2017 19:02:27,“The unemployment rate remains at a 17-year low of 4.1%. The unemployment rate in manufacturing dropped to 2.6% the lowest ever recorded. The unemployment rate among Hispanics dropped to 4.7% the lowest ever recorded...”@SecretaryAcosta @USDOL

12-09-2017 06:06:03,We believe that every American should stand for the National Anthem and we proudly pledge allegiance to one NATION UNDER GOD! 
12-09-2017 12:41:39,GREAT EVENING last night in Pensacola Florida. Arena was packed to the rafters the crowd was loud loving and really smart. They definitely get what’s going on. Thank you Pensacola!
12-09-2017 12:52:18,A big contingent of very enthusiastic Roy Moore fans at the rally last night. We can’t have a Pelosi/Schumer Liberal Democrat Jones in that important Alabama Senate seat. Need your vote to Make America Great Again! Jones will always vote against what we must do for our Country.
12-09-2017 13:02:23,Fake News CNN made a vicious and purposeful mistake yesterday. They were caught red handed just like lonely Brian Ross at ABC News (who should be immediately fired for his “mistake”). Watch to see if @CNN fires those responsible or was it just gross incompetence?
12-09-2017 13:21:24,CNN’S slogan is CNN THE MOST TRUSTED NAME IN NEWS. Everyone knows this is not true that this could in fact be a fraud on the American Public. There are many outlets that are far more trusted than Fake News CNN. Their slogan should be CNN THE LEAST TRUSTED NAME IN NEWS!
12-09-2017 15:45:47,Heading to the great state of Mississippi at the invitation of their popular and respected Governor @PhilBryantMS. Look forward to seeing the new Civil Rights Museum!
12-09-2017 18:37:31,Have a great game today @USArmy and @USNavy - I will be watching. We love our U.S. Military. On behalf of an entire Nation THANK YOU for your sacrifice and service! #ArmyNavyGame #USA🇺🇸 
12-09-2017 23:14:34,.@daveweigel of the Washington Post just admitted that his picture was a FAKE (fraud?) showing an almost empty arena last night for my speech in Pensacola when in fact he knew the arena was packed (as shown also on T.V.). FAKE NEWS he should be fired.
12-09-2017 23:39:15,Great Army - Navy Game. Army wins 14 to 13 and brings home the COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF’S TROPHY (last time was 1996). Wow! Congratulations!
12-09-2017 23:47:55,Great Army - Navy Game. Army wins 14 to 13 and brings home the COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF’S TROPHY! Congratulations!
12-10-2017 02:17:25,No American should be separated from their loved ones because of preventable crime committed by those illegally in our country. Our cities should be Sanctuaries for Americans – not for criminal aliens! 
12-10-2017 13:30:44,Things are going really well for our economy a subject the Fake News spends as little time as possible discussing! Stock Market hit another RECORD HIGH unemployment is now at a 17 year low and companies are coming back into the USA. Really good news and much more to come!
12-10-2017 13:35:28,Getting closer and closer on the Tax Cut Bill. Shaping up even better than projected. House and Senate working very hard and smart. End result will be not only important but SPECIAL!
12-10-2017 21:18:40,Very little discussion of all the purposely false and defamatory stories put out this week by the Fake News Media. They are out of control - correct reporting means nothing to them. Major lies written then forced to be withdrawn after they are exposed...a stain on America!
12-11-2017 14:17:18,Another false story this time in the Failing @nytimes that I watch 4-8 hours of television a day - Wrong!  Also I seldom if ever watch CNN or MSNBC both of which I consider Fake News. I never watch Don Lemon who I once called the “dumbest man on television!” Bad Reporting.
12-12-2017 12:10:58,Despite thousands of hours wasted and many millions of dollars spent the Democrats have been unable to show any collusion with Russia - so now they are moving on to the false accusations and fabricated stories of women who I don’t know and/or have never met. FAKE NEWS!
12-12-2017 14:09:26,The people of Alabama will do the right thing. Doug Jones is Pro-Abortion weak on Crime Military and Illegal Immigration Bad for Gun Owners and Veterans and against the WALL. Jones is a Pelosi/Schumer Puppet. Roy Moore will always vote with us. VOTE ROY MOORE!
12-12-2017 14:23:55,Consumer Confidence is at an All-Time High along with a Record High Stock Market. Unemployment is at a 17 year low. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Working to pass MASSIVE TAX CUTS (looking good).
12-12-2017 22:13:12,Wishing all of those celebrating #Hanukkah around the world a happy and healthy eight nights in the company of those they love.  
12-13-2017 04:08:41,Congratulations to Doug Jones on a hard fought victory. The write-in votes played a very big factor but a win is a win. The people of Alabama are great and the Republicans will have another shot at this seat in a very short period of time. It never ends!
12-13-2017 11:22:04,The reason I originally endorsed Luther Strange (and his numbers went up mightily) is that I said Roy Moore will not be able to win the General Election.  I was right! Roy worked hard but the deck was stacked against him!
12-13-2017 13:02:52,Wow more than 90% of Fake News Media coverage of me is negative with numerous forced retractions of untrue stories. Hence my use of Social Media the only way to get the truth out. Much of Mainstream Meadia has become a joke! @foxandfriends
12-13-2017 14:45:48,If last night’s election proved anything it proved that we need to put up GREAT Republican candidates to increase the razor thin margins in both the House and Senate.
12-13-2017 23:58:18,Thank you Omarosa for your service! I wish you continued success.
12-14-2017 12:59:56,Republican Tax Cuts are looking very good. All are working hard. In the meantime the Stock Market hit another record high!
12-14-2017 20:35:13,In 1960 there were approximately 20000 pages in the Code of Federal Regulations. Today there are over 185000 pages as seen in the Roosevelt Room.Today we CUT THE RED TAPE! It is time to SET FREE OUR DREAMS and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

12-17-2017 21:13:34,Wonderful weekend at Camp David. A very special place. A lot of very important work done. Heading back to the @WhiteHouse now. 
12-18-2017 11:23:49,Remember Republicans are 5-0 in Congressional Races this year. The media refuses to mention this. I said Gillespie and Moore would lose (for very different reasons) and they did. I also predicted  “I” would win. Republicans will do well in 2018 very well! @foxandfriends
12-18-2017 11:42:18,Ivanka Trump will be interviewed on @foxandfriends.
12-18-2017 18:41:05,The train accident that just occurred in DuPont WA shows more than ever why our soon to be submitted infrastructure plan must be approved quickly. Seven trillion dollars spent in the Middle East while our roads bridges tunnels railways (and more) crumble! Not for long!
12-18-2017 18:51:26,My thoughts and prayers are with everyone involved in the train accident in DuPont Washington. Thank you to all of our wonderful First Responders who are on the scene. We are currently monitoring here at the White House.
12-18-2017 19:35:38,Our deepest sympathies and most heartfelt prayers are with the victims of the train derailment in Washington State. We are closely monitoring the situation and coordinating with local authorities... 
12-18-2017 20:19:18,Over the past 11 months I have travelled tens of thousands of miles to visit 13 countries. I have met with more than 100 world leaders and everywhere I traveled it was my highest privilege and greatest honor to represent the AMERICAN PEOPLE! 
12-18-2017 20:28:19,When the American People speak ALL OF US should listen. Just over one year ago you spoke loud and clear. On November 8 2016 you voted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 
12-18-2017 20:40:08,As the world watches we are days away from passing HISTORIC TAX CUTS for American families and businesses. It will be the BIGGEST TAX CUT and TAX REFORM in the HISTORY of our country! 
12-18-2017 22:18:13,So true Ivanka! 
12-18-2017 22:20:20,Thank you Maria B!

12-19-2017 15:07:01,A  story in the @washingtonpost that I was close to “rescinding” the nomination of Justice Gorsuch prior to confirmation is FAKE NEWS. I never even wavered and am very proud of him and the job he is doing as a Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. The unnamed sources don’t exist!
12-19-2017 20:18:12,Congratulations to Paul Ryan Kevin McCarthy Kevin Brady Steve Scalise Cathy McMorris Rodgers and all great House Republicans who voted in favor of cutting your taxes!
12-20-2017 06:09:06,The United States Senate just passed the biggest in history Tax Cut and Reform Bill. Terrible Individual Mandate (ObamaCare)Repealed. Goes to the House tomorrow morning for final vote. If approved there will be a News Conference at The White House at approximately 1:00 P.M.
12-20-2017 14:32:51,The Tax Cuts are so large and so meaningful and yet the Fake News is working overtime to follow the lead of their friends the defeated Dems and only demean. This is truly a case where the results will speak for themselves starting very soon. Jobs Jobs Jobs!
12-20-2017 17:30:26,Together we are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 
12-20-2017 18:09:44,We are delivering HISTORIC TAX RELIEF for the American people!#TaxCutsandJobsAct 
12-20-2017 21:44:50,WE ARE MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 
12-21-2017 12:24:22,The Massive Tax Cuts which the Fake News Media is desperate to write badly about so as to please their Democrat bosses will soon be kicking in and will speak for themselves. Companies are already making big payments to workers. Dems want to raise taxes hate these big Cuts!
12-21-2017 12:45:17,Was @foxandfriends just named the most influential show in news? You deserve it - three great people! The many Fake News Hate Shows should study your formula for success!
12-21-2017 13:56:28,Home Sales hit BEST numbers in 10 years! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
12-21-2017 14:52:22,House Democrats want a SHUTDOWN for the holidays in order to distract from the very popular just passed Tax Cuts. House Republicans don’t let this happen. Pass the C.R. TODAY and keep our Government OPEN!
12-21-2017 18:16:28,THANK YOU to everyone who joined me at the @WhiteHouse yesterday. Together we are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  
12-22-2017 12:47:51,Our big and very popular Tax Cut and Reform Bill has taken on an unexpected new source of “love” - that is big companies and corporations showering their workers with bonuses. This is a phenomenon that nobody even thought of and now it is the rage. Merry Christmas!
12-22-2017 12:50:42,So true! 
12-22-2017 13:05:06,At some point and for the good of the country I predict we will start working with the Democrats in a Bipartisan fashion. Infrastructure would be a perfect place to start. After having foolishly spent $7 trillion in the Middle East it is time to start rebuilding our country!
12-22-2017 15:04:39,With all my Administration has done on Legislative Approvals (broke Harry Truman’s Record) Regulation Cutting Judicial Appointments Building Military VA TAX CUTS  REFORM Record Economy/Stock Market and so much more I am sure great credit will be given by mainstream news?
12-22-2017 15:07:55,Will be signing the biggest ever Tax Cut and Reform Bill in 30 minutes in Oval Office. Will also be signing a much needed 4 billion dollar missile defense bill.
12-22-2017 16:46:49,95% of Americans will pay less or at worst the same amount of taxes (mostly far less). The Dems only want to raise your taxes!
12-22-2017 18:40:29,Congressman Ron DeSantis is a brilliant young leader Yale and then Harvard Law who would make a GREAT Governor of Florida. He loves our Country and is a true FIGHTER!
12-22-2017 20:47:15,The United Nations Security Council just voted 15-0 in favor of additional Sanctions on North Korea. The World wants Peace not Death!
12-22-2017 20:47:43,Today it was my great honor to sign the largest TAX CUTS and reform in the history of our country. Full remarks:  
12-22-2017 22:11:56,Remember the most hated part of ObamaCare is the Individual Mandate which is being terminated under our just signed Tax Cut Bill.
12-23-2017 20:27:05,How can FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe the man in charge along with leakin’ James Comey of the Phony Hillary Clinton investigation (including her 33000 illegally deleted emails) be given $700000 for wife’s campaign by Clinton Puppets during investigation?
12-23-2017 20:30:06,FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is racing the clock to retire with full benefits. 90 days to go?!!!
12-23-2017 20:32:42,Wow “FBI lawyer James Baker reassigned” according to @FoxNews.
12-23-2017 22:44:45,The Stock Market is setting record after record and unemployment is at a 17 year low. So many things accomplished by the Trump Administration perhaps more than any other President in first year. Sadly will never be reported correctly by the Fake News Media!
12-23-2017 22:57:50,Remember the Republicans are 5-0 in Congressional races this year. In Senate I said Roy M would lose in Alabama and supported Big Luther Strange - and Roy lost. Virginia candidate was not a “Trumper” and he lost.  Good Republican candidates will win BIG!
12-24-2017 12:25:22,.@FoxNews-FBI’s Andrew McCabe “in addition to his wife getting all of this money from M (Clinton Puppet) he was using allegedly his FBI Official Email Account to promote her campaign. You obviously cannot do this. These were the people who were investigating Hillary Clinton.”
12-24-2017 13:48:11,The Fake News refuses to talk about how Big and how Strong our BASE is. They show Fake Polls just like they report Fake News. Despite only negative reporting we are doing well - nobody is going to beat us. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
12-24-2017 20:35:26,The Tax Cut/Reform Bill including Massive Alaska Drilling and the Repeal of the highly unpopular Individual Mandate brought it all together as to what an incredible year we had. Don’t let the Fake News convince you otherwise...and our insider Polls are strong!
12-25-2017 02:56:19,People are proud to be saying Merry Christmas again. I am proud to have led the charge against the assault of our cherished and beautiful phrase. MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!!!
12-25-2017 03:51:52,MERRY CHRISTMAS!! 
12-25-2017 13:36:51,MERRY CHRISTMAS!!! 
12-25-2017 23:33:55,I hope everyone is having a great Christmas then tomorrow it’s back to work in order to Make America Great Again (which is happening faster than anyone anticipated)!
12-26-2017 11:58:42,Based on the fact that the very unfair and unpopular Individual Mandate has been terminated as part of our Tax Cut Bill which essentially Repeals (over time) ObamaCare the Democrats  Republicans will eventually come together and develop a great new HealthCare plan!
12-26-2017 13:24:27,WOW @foxandfrlends  “Dossier is bogus. Clinton Campaign DNC funded Dossier. FBI CANNOT (after all of this time) VERIFY CLAIMS IN DOSSIER OF RUSSIA/TRUMP COLLUSION. FBI TAINTED.” And they used this Crooked Hillary pile of garbage as the basis for going after the Trump Campaign!
12-26-2017 22:17:14,All signs are that business is looking really good for next year only to be helped further by our Tax Cut Bill. Will be a great year for Companies and JOBS! Stock Market is poised for another year of SUCCESS!
12-27-2017 23:11:13,Just left West Palm Beach Fire  Rescue #2. Met with great men and women as representatives of those who do so much for all of us. Firefighters paramedics first responders - what amazing people they are!
12-28-2017 02:46:30,“Arrests of MS-13 Members Associates Up 83% Under Trump” 
12-28-2017 16:18:20,Retail sales are at record numbers. We’ve got the economy going better than anyone ever dreamt - and you haven’t seen anything yet!
12-28-2017 16:24:08,Caught RED HANDED - very disappointed that China is allowing oil to go into North Korea. There will never be a friendly solution to the North Korea problem if this continues to happen!
12-28-2017 19:20:47,I've been saying it for a long long time. #NoKo 
12-28-2017 23:14:21,Together we are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  
12-29-2017 00:01:47,In the East it could be the COLDEST New Year’s Eve on record. Perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming that our Country but not other countries was going to pay TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS to protect against. Bundle up!
12-29-2017 12:46:23,While the Fake News loves to talk about my so-called low approval rating @foxandfriends just showed that my rating on Dec. 28 2017 was approximately the same as President Obama on Dec. 28 2009 which was 47%...and this despite massive negative Trump coverage  Russia hoax!
12-29-2017 13:04:09,Why is the United States Post Office which is losing many billions of dollars a year while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer? Should be charging MUCH MORE!
12-29-2017 13:16:11,The Democrats have been told and fully understand that there can be no DACA without the desperately needed WALL at the Southern Border and an END to the horrible Chain Migration  ridiculous Lottery System of Immigration etc. We must protect our Country at all cost!
12-30-2017 19:00:54,The entire world understands that the good people of Iran want change and other than the vast military power of the United States that Iran’s people are what their leaders fear the most.... 
12-30-2017 19:02:53,Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever and the day will come when the Iranian people will face a choice. The world is watching! 
12-30-2017 21:12:45,On Taxes: “This is the biggest corporate rate cut ever going back to the corporate income tax rate of roughly 80 years ago.This is a huge pro-growth stimulus for the economy. Every year the Obama WH overstated how the economy would grow. Now real economics and jobs.” @WSJ Report
12-30-2017 22:36:41,I use Social Media not because I like to but because it is the only way to fight a VERY dishonest and unfair “press” now often referred to as Fake News Media. Phony and non-existent “sources” are being used more often than ever. Many stories  reports a pure fiction!
12-30-2017 22:42:09,Jobs are kicking in and companies are coming back to the U.S. Unnecessary regulations and high taxes are being dramatically Cut and it will only get better. MUCH MORE TO COME!
12-31-2017 04:46:21,“Trump Rally: Stocks put 2017 in the record books” 
12-31-2017 13:03:29,Big protests in Iran. The people are finally getting wise as to how their money and wealth is being stolen and squandered on terrorism. Looks like they will not take it any longer. The USA is watching very closely for human rights violations!
12-31-2017 13:26:29,If the Dems (Crooked Hillary) got elected your stocks would be down 50% from values on Election Day. Now they have a great future - and just beginning! 
12-31-2017 13:36:32,Why would smart voters want to put Democrats in Congress in 2018 Election when their policies will totally kill the great wealth created during the months since the Election. People are much better off now not to mention ISIS VA Judges Strong Border 2nd A Tax Cuts  more?
12-31-2017 18:36:28,My deepest condolences to the victims of the terrible shooting in Douglas County @DCSheriff and their families. We love our police and law enforcement - God Bless them all! #LESM
12-31-2017 19:06:52,What a year it’s been and we're just getting started. Together we are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Happy New Year!! 
12-31-2017 22:00:21,Iran the Number One State of Sponsored Terror with numerous violations of Human Rights occurring on an hourly basis has now closed down the Internet so that peaceful demonstrators cannot communicate. Not good!
12-31-2017 22:18:20,As our Country rapidly grows stronger and smarter I want to wish all of my friends supporters enemies haters and even the very dishonest Fake News Media a Happy and Healthy New Year. 2018 will be a great year for America!
12-31-2017 23:43:04,HAPPY NEW YEAR! We are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN and much faster than anyone thought possible!
01-01-2018 13:37:52,Will be leaving Florida for Washington (D.C.) today at 4:00 P.M. Much work to be done but it will be a great New Year!
01-02-2018 12:09:17,The people of Iran are finally acting against the brutal and corrupt Iranian regime. All of the money that President Obama so foolishly gave them went into terrorism and into their “pockets.” The people have little food big inflation and no human rights. The U.S. is watching!
01-02-2018 13:44:33,Thank you to Brandon Judd of the National Border Patrol Council for your kind words on how well we are doing at the Border. We will be bringing in more  more of your great folks and will build the desperately needed WALL! @foxandfriends
01-02-2018 13:49:23,Companies are giving big bonuses to their workers because of the Tax Cut Bill. Really great!
01-02-2018 14:08:56,Sanctions and “other” pressures are beginning to have a big impact on North Korea. Soldiers are dangerously fleeing to South Korea. Rocket man now wants to talk to South Korea for first time. Perhaps that is good news perhaps not - we will see!
01-02-2018 14:13:13,Since taking office I have been very strict on Commercial Aviation. Good news - it was just reported that there were Zero deaths in 2017 the best and safest year on record!
01-02-2018 14:39:49,The Failing New York Times has a new publisher A.G. Sulzberger. Congratulations! Here is a last chance for the Times to fulfill the vision of its Founder Adolph Ochs “to give the news impartially without fear or FAVOR regardless of party sect or interests involved.” Get...
01-02-2018 14:53:47,....impartial journalists of a much higher standard lose all of your phony and non-existent “sources” and treat the President of the United States FAIRLY so that the next time I (and the people) win you won’t have to write an apology to your readers for a job poorly done! GL
01-02-2018 15:16:38,Democrats are doing nothing for DACA - just interested in politics.  DACA activists and Hispanics will go hard against Dems will start “falling in love” with Republicans and their President! We are about RESULTS.
01-02-2018 18:11:11,We will not rest until all of America’s GREAT VETERANS can receive the care they so richly deserve. Tremendous progress has been made in a short period of time. Keep up the great work @SecShulkin @DeptVetAffairs!  
01-02-2018 22:37:56,It's not only Pakistan that we pay billions of dollars to for nothing but also many other countries and others. As an example we pay the Palestinians HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect. They don’t even want to negotiate a long overdue...
01-02-2018 22:37:57,...peace treaty with Israel. We have taken Jerusalem the toughest part of the negotiation off the table but Israel for that would have had to pay more. But with the Palestinians no longer willing to talk peace why should we make any of these massive future payments to them?
01-03-2018 01:05:10,I will be announcing THE MOST DISHONEST  CORRUPT MEDIA AWARDS OF THE YEAR on Monday at 5:00 o’clock. Subjects will cover Dishonesty  Bad Reporting in various categories from the Fake News Media. Stay tuned!
01-03-2018 01:16:57,Watch @seanhannity tonight at 9:00 P.M.
01-03-2018 04:03:01,“President Trump has something now he didn’t have a year ago that is a set of accomplishments that nobody can deny. The accomplishments are there look at his record he has had a very significant first year.” @LouDobbs ShowDavid Asman  Ed Rollins
01-03-2018 13:37:13,Such respect for the people of Iran as they try to take back their corrupt government. You will see great support from the United States at the appropriate time!
01-04-2018 01:06:06,Melania and I are deeply saddened by the death of Thomas S. Monson a beloved President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints...
01-04-2018 02:07:37,“Some 40 U.S. companies have responded to President Trump’s tax cut and reform victory in Congress last year by handing out bonuses up to $2000 increases in 401k matches and spending on charity a much higher number than previously known.” 
01-04-2018 02:11:31,Stock Market had another good day but now that the Tax Cut Bill has passed we have tremendous upward potential. Dow just short of 25000 a number that few thought would be possible this soon into my administration. Also unemployment went down to 4.1%. Only getting better!
01-04-2018 02:13:16,MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
01-04-2018 11:02:14,Many mostly Democrat States refused to hand over data from the 2016 Election to the Commission On Voter Fraud. They fought hard that the Commission not see their records or methods because they know that many people are voting illegally. System is rigged must go to Voter I.D.
01-04-2018 11:11:45,As Americans you need identification sometimes in a very strong and accurate form for almost everything you do.....except when it comes to the most important thing VOTING for the people that run your country. Push hard for Voter Identification!
01-04-2018 11:32:22,With all of the failed “experts” weighing in does anybody really believe that talks and dialogue would be going on between North and South Korea right now if I wasn’t firm strong and willing to commit our total “might” against the North. Fools but talks are a good thing!
01-04-2018 11:37:46,So beautiful....Show this picture to the NFL players who still kneel! 
01-04-2018 15:48:04,Dow just crashes through 25000. Congrats! Big cuts in unnecessary regulations continuing.
01-05-2018 00:11:26,MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 
01-05-2018 03:52:53,I authorized Zero access to White House (actually turned him down many times) for author of phony book! I never spoke to him for book. Full of lies misrepresentations and sources that don’t exist. Look at this guy’s past and watch what happens to him and Sloppy Steve!
01-05-2018 04:04:20,The Fake News Media barely mentions the fact that the Stock Market just hit another New Record and that business in the U.S. is booming...but the people know! Can you imagine if “O” was president and had these numbers - would be biggest story on earth! Dow now over 25000.
01-05-2018 11:35:30,Dow goes from 18589 on November 9 2016 to 25075 today for a new all-time Record. Jumped 1000 points in last 5 weeks Record fastest 1000 point move in history. This is all about the Make America Great Again agenda! Jobs Jobs Jobs. Six trillion dollars in value created!
01-05-2018 14:32:44,Well now that collusion with Russia is proving to be a total hoax and the only collusion is with Hillary Clinton and the FBI/Russia the Fake News Media (Mainstream) and this phony new book are hitting out at every new front imaginable. They should try winning an election. Sad!
01-05-2018 15:34:28,The Mercer Family recently dumped the leaker known as Sloppy Steve Bannon. Smart!
01-06-2018 04:19:10,Good idea Rand! 
01-06-2018 11:49:02,The African American unemployment rate fell to 6.8% the lowest rate in 45 years. I am so happy about this News! And in the Washington Post (of all places) headline states “Trumps first year jobs numbers were very very good.”
01-06-2018 11:57:35,Brian Ross the reporter who made a fraudulent live newscast about me that drove the Stock Market down 350 points (billions of dollars) was suspended for a month but is now back at ABC NEWS in a lower capacity. He is no longer allowed to report on Trump. Should have been fired!
01-06-2018 12:19:10,Now that Russian collusion after one year of intense study has proven to be a total hoax on the American public the Democrats and their lapdogs the Fake News Mainstream Media are taking out the old Ronald Reagan playbook and screaming mental stability and intelligence.....
01-06-2018 12:27:42,....Actually throughout my life my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being like really smart. Crooked Hillary Clinton also played these cards very hard and as everyone knows went down in flames. I went from VERY successful businessman to top T.V. Star.....
01-06-2018 12:30:51,....to President of the United States (on my first try). I think that would qualify as not smart but genius....and a very stable genius at that!
01-07-2018 14:33:10,Leaving Camp David for the White House. Great meetings with the Cabinet and Military on many very important subjects including Border Security  the desperately needed Wall the ever increasing Drug and Opioid Problem Infrastructure Military Budget Trade and DACA.
01-07-2018 14:40:06,I’ve had to put up with the Fake News from the first day I announced that I would be running for President. Now I have to put up with a Fake Book written by a totally discredited author. Ronald Reagan had the same problem and handled it well. So will I!
01-07-2018 15:15:50,Jake Tapper of Fake News CNN just got destroyed in his interview with Stephen Miller of the Trump Administration. Watch the hatred and unfairness of this CNN flunky!
01-07-2018 20:35:39,The Fake News Awards those going to the most corrupt  biased of the Mainstream Media will be presented to the losers on Wednesday January 17th rather than this coming Monday. The interest in and importance of these awards is far greater than anyone could have anticipated!
01-07-2018 20:42:13,The Stock Market has been creating tremendous benefits for our country in the form of not only Record Setting Stock Prices but present and future Jobs Jobs Jobs. Seven TRILLION dollars of value created since our big election win!
01-08-2018 02:21:25,“His is turning out to be an enormously consensual presidency. So much so that...there has never been a day that I wished Hillary Clinton were President. Not one. Indeed as Trump’s accomplishments accumulate the mere thought of Clinton in the W.H. doubling down on Obama’s.....

01-08-2018 14:20:25,African American unemployment is the lowest ever recorded in our country. The Hispanic unemployment rate dropped a full point in the last year and is close to the lowest in recorded history. Dems did nothing for you but get your vote!  #NeverForget  @foxandfriends
01-08-2018 19:06:40,Can’t wait to be back in the amazing state of Tennessee to address the 99th American @FarmBureau Federation’s Annual Convention in Nashville! #AFBF18On my way now - join me LIVE at 4:00pmE: . 
01-08-2018 22:58:13,We have been working every day to DELIVER for America’s Farmers just as they work every day to deliver FOR US. #AFBF18 
01-08-2018 23:19:47,We are fighting for our farmers for our country and for our GREAT AMERICAN FLAG. We want our flag respected - and we want our NATIONAL ANTHEM respected also! 
01-09-2018 22:51:50,Thanks to all of the Republican and Democratic lawmakers for today’s very productive meeting on immigration reform. There was strong agreement to negotiate a bill that deals with border security chain migration lottery and DACA.  
01-10-2018 00:16:57,As I made very clear today our country needs the security of the Wall on the Southern Border which must be part of any DACA approval.
01-10-2018 03:48:26,Thank you @GOPLeader Kevin McCarthy! Couldn’t agree w/you more. TOGETHER we are #MAGA🇺🇸 
01-10-2018 04:23:58,.@ICEgov HSI agents and ERO officers on behalf of an entire Nation THANK YOU for what you are doing 24/7/365 to keep fellow American’s SAFE. Everyone is so grateful!#LawEnforcementAppreciationDayPresident @realDonaldTrump 
01-10-2018 14:11:13,It just shows everyone how broken and unfair our Court System is when the opposing side in a case (such as DACA) always runs to the 9th Circuit and almost always wins before being reversed by higher courts.
01-10-2018 15:00:29,The fact that Sneaky Dianne Feinstein who has on numerous occasions stated that collusion between Trump/Russia has not been found would release testimony in such an underhanded and possibly illegal way totally without authorization is a disgrace. Must have tough Primary!
01-10-2018 20:08:37,I want to thank my @Cabinet for working tirelessly on behalf of our country. 2017 was a year of monumental achievement and we look forward to the year ahead. Together we are delivering results and MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  
01-10-2018 21:31:30,Today it was my great honor to welcome Prime Minister Erna Solberg of Norway to the @WhiteHouse - a great friend and ally of the United States! Joint press conference:  
01-10-2018 23:07:48,The United States needs the security of the Wall on the Southern Border which must be part of any DACA approval. The safety and security of our country is #1! 
01-10-2018 23:37:41,Cutting taxes and simplifying regulations makes America the place to invest! Great news as Toyota and Mazda announce they are bringing 4000 JOBS and investing $1.6 BILLION in Alabama helping to further grow our economy! 
01-11-2018 04:29:02,Good news: Toyota and Mazda announce giant new Huntsville Alabama plant which will produce over 300000 cars and SUV’s a year and employ 4000 people. Companies are coming back to the U.S. in a very big way. Congratulations Alabama!
01-11-2018 11:33:06,Disproven and paid for by Democrats “Dossier used to spy on Trump Campaign. Did FBI use Intel tool to influence the Election?” @foxandfriends  Did Dems or Clinton also pay Russians? Where are hidden and smashed DNC servers? Where are Crooked Hillary Emails?  What a mess!
01-11-2018 11:43:59,In new Quinnipiac Poll 66% of people feel the economy is “Excellent or Good.” That is the highest number ever recorded by this poll.
01-11-2018 12:33:21,“House votes on controversial FISA ACT today.” This is the act that may have been used with the help of the discredited and phony Dossier to so badly surveil and abuse the Trump Campaign by the previous administration and others?
01-11-2018 13:11:46,“45 year low in illegal immigration this year.” @foxandfriends
01-11-2018 14:14:51,With that being said I have personally directed the fix to the unmasking process since taking office and today’s vote is about foreign surveillance of foreign bad guys on foreign land. We need it! Get smart!
01-11-2018 15:37:54,Great news as a result of our TAX CUTS  JOBS ACT! 
01-12-2018 02:43:56,Thank you Adam Levine The Federalist in interview on @foxandfriends  “Donald Trump is the greatest President our Country has ever seen.”
01-12-2018 02:47:17,Small Business Poll has highest approval numbers in the polls history. All business is just at the beginning of something really special!
01-12-2018 02:53:05,Chrysler is moving a massive plant from Mexico to Michigan reversing a years long opposite trend. Thank you Chrysler a very wise decision. The voters in Michigan are very happy they voted for Trump/Pence. Plenty of more to follow!
01-12-2018 03:01:20,Democrat Dianne Feinstein should never have released secret committee testimony to the public without authorization. Very disrespectful to committee members and possibly illegal. She blamed her poor decision on the fact she had a cold - a first!
01-12-2018 04:42:25,The Democrats seem intent on having people and drugs pour into our country from the Southern Border risking thousands of lives in the process. It is my duty to protect the lives and safety of all Americans. We must build a Great Wall think Merit and end Lottery  Chain. USA!
01-12-2018 04:57:57,Reason I canceled my trip to London is that I am not a big fan of the Obama Administration having sold perhaps the best located and finest embassy in London for “peanuts” only to build a new one in an off location for 1.2 billion dollars. Bad deal. Wanted me to cut ribbon-NO!
01-12-2018 12:09:58,....countries which are doing badly. I want a merit based system of immigration and people who will help take our country to the next level. I want safety and security for our people. I want to stop the massive inflow of drugs. I want to fund our military not do a Dem defund....
01-12-2018 12:20:32,....Because of the Democrats not being interested in life and safety DACA has now taken a big step backwards. The Dems will threaten “shutdown” but what they are really doing is shutting down our military at a time we need it most. Get smart MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
01-12-2018 12:28:58,The language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough but this was not the language used. What was really tough was the outlandish proposal made - a big setback for DACA!
01-12-2018 12:50:00,Sadly Democrats want to stop paying our troops and government workers in order to give a sweetheart deal not a fair deal for DACA. Take care of our Military and our Country FIRST!
01-12-2018 13:48:49,Never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is obviously a very poor and troubled country. Never said “take them out.” Made up by Dems. I have a wonderful relationship with Haitians. Probably should record future meetings - unfortunately no trust!
01-12-2018 17:56:18,Today it was my great honor to proclaim January 15 2018 as Martin Luther King Jr. Federal Holiday. I encourage all Americans to observe this day with appropriate civic community and service activities in honor of Dr. King's life and legacy. 
01-13-2018 13:13:12,Yesterday was a big day for the stock market. Jobs are coming back to America. Chrysler is coming back to the USA from Mexico and many others will follow. Tax cut money to employees is pouring into our economy with many more companies announcing. American business is hot again!
01-13-2018 13:14:03,The Democrats are all talk and no action. They are doing nothing to fix DACA. Great opportunity missed. Too bad!
01-13-2018 13:14:20,AMERICA FIRST!
01-13-2018 14:20:00,Yesterday was another big day for jobs and the Stock Market. Chrysler coming back to U.S. (Michigan) from Mexico and many more companies paying out Tax Cut money to employees. If Dems won in November Market would have TANKED! It was headed for disaster.
01-13-2018 14:20:01,I don’t believe the Democrats really want to see a deal on DACA. They are all talk and no action. This is the time but day by day they are blowing the one great opportunity they have. Too bad!
01-13-2018 22:08:34,So much Fake News is being reported. They don’t even try to get it right or correct it when they are wrong. They promote the Fake Book of a mentally deranged author who knowingly writes false information. The Mainstream Media is crazed that WE won the election!
01-14-2018 12:58:43,The Wall Street Journal stated falsely that I said to them “I have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un” (of N. Korea). Obviously I didn’t say that. I said “I’d have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un” a big difference. Fortunately we now record conversations with reporters...
01-14-2018 13:01:44,...and they knew exactly what I said and meant. They just wanted a story. FAKE NEWS!
01-14-2018 13:09:09,DACA is probably dead because the Democrats don’t really want it they just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our Military.
01-14-2018 13:19:06,I as President want people coming into our Country who are going to help us become strong and great again people coming in through a system based on MERIT. No more Lotteries! #AMERICA FIRST
01-14-2018 13:50:14,“President Trump is not getting the credit he deserves for the economy. Tax Cut bonuses to more than 2000000 workers. Most explosive Stock Market rally that we’ve seen in modern times. 18000 to 26000 from Election and grounded in profitability and growth. All Trump not 0...
01-14-2018 13:59:35,...big unnecessary regulation cuts made it all possible” (among many other things). “President Trump reversed the policies of President Obama and reversed our economic decline.” Thank you Stuart Varney.  @foxandfriends
01-15-2018 12:57:43,Statement by me last night in Florida: “Honestly I don’t think the Democrats want to make a deal. They talk about DACA but they don’t want to help..We are ready willing and able to make a deal but they don’t want to. They don’t want security at the border they don’t want.....
01-15-2018 13:02:22,...to stop drugs they want to take money away from our military which we cannot do.” My standard is very simple AMERICA FIRST  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
01-15-2018 20:28:15,Senator Dicky Durbin totally misrepresented what was said at the DACA meeting. Deals can’t get made when there is no trust! Durbin blew DACA and is hurting our Military.
01-16-2018 13:54:02,We must have Security at our VERY DANGEROUS SOUTHERN BORDER and we must have a great WALL to help protect us and to help stop the massive inflow of drugs pouring into our country!
01-16-2018 14:07:38,The Democrats want to shut down the Government over Amnesty for all and Border Security. The biggest loser will be our rapidly rebuilding Military at a time we need it more than ever. We need a merit based system of immigration and we need it now! No more dangerous Lottery.
01-16-2018 14:19:46,Do you notice the Fake News Mainstream Media never likes covering the great and record setting economic news but rather talks about anything negative or that can be turned into the negative. The Russian Collusion Hoax is dead except as it pertains to the Dems. Public gets it!
01-16-2018 14:24:40,“90% of Trump 2017 news coverage was negative” -and much of it contrived!@foxandfriends
01-16-2018 14:30:00,Unemployment for Black Americans is the lowest ever recorded. Trump approval ratings with Black Americans has doubled. Thank you and it will get even (much) better! @FoxNews
01-16-2018 19:43:32,“President Donald J. Trump Proclaims January 16 2018 as Religious Freedom Day” 
01-16-2018 20:17:39,Today it was my honor to welcome President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan to the @WhiteHouse! 
01-16-2018 23:19:39,New report from DOJ  DHS shows that nearly 3 in 4 individuals convicted of terrorism-related charges are foreign-born. We have submitted to Congress a list of resources and reforms....
01-16-2018 23:20:10,....we need to keep America safe including moving away from a random chain migration and lottery system to one that is merit-based. 
01-17-2018 13:04:46,Eric Trump on @foxandfriends  now!
01-17-2018 23:19:02,Today we witnessed an incredible moment in history – the presentation of Congress’ highest civilian honor to our friend and true AMERICAN HERO Bob Dole. #CongressionalGoldMedal 
01-17-2018 23:28:30,I promised that my policies would allow companies like Apple to bring massive amounts of money back to the United States. Great to see Apple follow through as a result of TAX CUTS. Huge win for American workers and the USA! 
01-17-2018 23:32:58,During the campaign I promised to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN by bringing businesses and jobs back to our country. I am very proud to see companies like Chrysler moving operations from Mexico to Michigan where there are so many great American workers! 
01-17-2018 23:36:44,Main Street is BACK! Strongest Holiday Sales bump since the Great Recession -- beating forecasts by BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. 
01-18-2018 01:00:05,And the FAKE NEWS winners are...
01-18-2018 01:05:46,Despite some very corrupt and dishonest media coverage there are many great reporters I respect and lots of GOOD NEWS for the American people to be proud of!
01-18-2018 01:11:26,ISIS is in retreat our economy is booming investments and jobs are pouring back into the country and so much more! Together there is nothing we can’t overcome--even a very biased media. We ARE Making America Great Again!
01-18-2018 11:15:25,The Wall is the Wall it has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it. Parts will be of necessity see through and it was never intended to be built in areas where there is natural protection such as mountains wastelands or tough rivers or water.....
01-18-2018 11:25:03,....The Wall will be paid for directly or indirectly or through longer term reimbursement by Mexico which has a ridiculous $71 billion dollar trade surplus with the U.S. The $20 billion dollar Wall is “peanuts” compared to what Mexico makes from the U.S. NAFTA is a bad joke!
01-18-2018 12:53:17,Will be going to Pennsylvania today in order to give my total support to RICK SACCONE running for Congress in a Special Election (March 13). Rick is a great guy. We need more Republicans to continue our already successful agenda!
01-18-2018 13:16:26,We need the Wall for the safety and security of our country. We need the Wall to help stop the massive inflow of drugs from Mexico now rated the number one most dangerous country in the world. If there is no Wall there is no Deal!
01-18-2018 13:37:24,CHIP should be part of a long term solution not a 30 Day or short term extension!
01-18-2018 13:49:11,A government shutdown will be devastating to our military...something the Dems care very little about!
01-18-2018 20:45:33,Departing Pittsburgh now where it was my great honor to stand with our incredible workers and to show the world that AMERICA is back - and we are coming back bigger and better and stronger than ever before! 
01-18-2018 23:39:53,House of Representatives needs to pass Government Funding Bill tonight. So important for our country - our Military needs it!
